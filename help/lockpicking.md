To pick the lock on a chest or door you first need a lockpick set, which you 
should wield in one hand while assisting with the other (see 'help assist').

You should then target the chest or door you wish to open, using your assisting
hand to perform the available techniques.  Every time you perform a lockpicking
technique, the lock will make a sound to indicate the state of its tumblers; a 
*clUnk* means that the tumbler is under the desired value, a *clOnk* means that
the tumbler is over the desired value, and a *click* means that the tumbler is
correctly aligned.  When all the tumblers *click*, the lock will open.

Each technique (except for probe) will move one or more tumblers by one or two 
positions in a direction - '>' increases a tumbler by one, '<<' decreases a 
tumbler by two, and so on.  Each of the three lockpicks has different available
moves, and you'll usually have to use them all to open a lock.

If you try to move a tumbler too high or low, the lock will jam, meaning your 
lockpicking technique failed to do anything; try using a different technique.

The chest must be lying on the ground in order to be opened.  The safest way to
do this is to drop the chest in a store on your home plane, where it autosaves.
