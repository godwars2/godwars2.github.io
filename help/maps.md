To decypher a map you must first wield it, and assist with the other hand (see
'help assist').  Each hand then has access to a selection of techniques, each 
of which increases or decreases two or more of the five cyphers on the map.

You should use your techniques to adjust the cyphers so that they are all set
as correct.  If your technique would raise or lower a cypher too far, you will
be told that you're confused, which means that the technique failed to work.

Once you've finished decyphering the map, you can examine it to get directions
to a magical node in the Nexus.  Examine the map again at the node, defeat the
guardian spirit, and your boost points (NOT active boosts) will be converted
into primal at the rate of 50 primal per 0.01 boost points (although it won't
convert more than the number you need to train a single stat).

Your first completed map each day gives you an alternative benefit (except for 
energy maps, which always work as described above): An age map costs 1.0 boost 
points and gives you a free stat train, a power map costs 0.5 boost points and 
gives you a free power train, and a renewal map costs 5.0 boost points and 
resets your monthly 'train reroll' option (see 'help reroll').

Upon reaching age 300, age maps will function as energy maps.  Equally, after 
reaching 180 total power ranks, power maps will also function as energy maps.
