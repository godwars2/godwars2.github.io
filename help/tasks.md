This command displays your list of current tasks.  Each character may only 
complete each task once, and each task gives a special reward.  Completing 
a task may also result in new tasks being unlocked.

You can type 'task <name of task>' or 'help <name of task>' to find out more 
information about each specific task, including what reward it gives.

Some tasks take place in dungeons.  The 'find' and 'area' commands can make it 
easier to locate the entrances to such dungeons, and you should probably also 
fabricate a wand before you set off (see 'help fabricate').
