  - sacrifice <number of soul points>

This command transfers the specified number of soul points from your character
to your pantheon.  There is no direct benefit in doing this, but when being 
promoted by anything below a Major God, you must have contributed at least 
enough soul points to cover the cost of your promotion.

The total number of soul points you've contributed is displayed beside your 
name when viewing the deities of a pantheon.  Should you be outcast from the 
pantheon, all soul points you've contributed will be refunded.

For obvious reasons, this command is only available to those in pantheons.
