Your character has three defence ratings - one for your left hand, one for your
right hand, and one for your feet - and these are calculated in the same seven 
steps as your Attack rating (see 'help attack').  Whenever you are struck in 
combat, the mud will use your best available location to try and prevent the 
blow from landing.

Each location takes a period of time (see 'help cooldown') to recover before 
it can be used for another defence.  While it is recovering, your second best 
defence will be used - and then your third best.  If all of your locations are 
still recovering then you will have a Defence of 1.

In your score your current best available defensive location is marked between
'>' and '<'.  No markers means you have no defence.  Each location is also 
colour coded to indicate whether it is able to stop all attacks, paired melee
attacks, normal melee attacks or unarmed attacks (with '-' indicating that no 
defence is available for that location).  If you have an ethereal defence, it 
will only be able to stop ethereal attacks.

Please note that any defensive technique bonuses from your feet combat table 
are applied to all locations, but are doubled for your feet location.  Your 
total encumbrance is also subtracted from your feet Defence.
