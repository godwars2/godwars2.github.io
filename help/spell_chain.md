Typically refers to a chain of 3 bolt spells using pos on one hand, such as:

- Firebolt, Lightning Bolt and Icebolt from Fire, Air and Water Magic respectively for Mages,
- Lightning bolt and Spirit bolt from Ride the Storm, and Icebolt from Greater Crow Spirit for Werewolves,
- Shadowbolt and Black Lightning from Path of Shadows, and Icebolt from Waterborn Adept for Vampires.

Vampires can get two Shadowbolts with sp and ps techs, effectively creating a chain as well.

Dragons have Cold, Shock, Heat, and Gas Wave chains with up to 4 spells over 6 techs at rank 40 in Chill of the Tundra, Eye of the Storm, Fires of the Volcano and Fumes of the Pit respectively.
