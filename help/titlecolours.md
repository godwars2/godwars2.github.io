This command allows you to set the colours for your pantheon title.  The 
first colour is used for your outer brackets, the second for your inner 
brackets, and the third for the pantheon title itself.  Only the Supreme 
God of the pantheon can set the brackets, although they may be changed at 
any time.

Each colour must be a single letter - 'R' for light red, 'c' for dark cyan, 
etc.  The available colours are listed in 'help colour'.
