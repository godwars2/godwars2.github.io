This command allows you to adjust your appearance.  The options available may
vary based on your form, and generally don't apply when shapechanged (although 
your hair colour in human form will determine your fur colour as a wolf, for 
example).  To view a list of available options type 'appearance'.  You can get 
a list of the available values for that option by typing 'appearance \<option\>',
for example 'appearance eyes' will list the available eye colours.

Certain talents and powers may override certain appearance options.

Note that this command is only available when you are on your home plane.
