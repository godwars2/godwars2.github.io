Some monsters drop craftable material when they are killed, such as pieces of 
spidersilk, fragments of chitin or shards of bone.  You may use this material 
to create an item of your choice by wielding it and then using the appropriate 
combination technique.  The types of item available will depend on the size and
type of the material; small, medium and large each have their own item lists.

To view which techniques create which items, type 'r? info' (or 'l? info', if 
you are crafting with your left hand).  The item you create will have the same 
magical type and rarity as the material it came from (see 'help magic items'), 
and its power will be based on the age of the mob that the material came from.

Large and medium pieces of material may be split into two smaller pieces by 
performing the use command while assisting (eg 'ru' while holding the material 
in your right hand and assisting with the left).  Each of the smaller pieces 
will retain the magical type, rarity and age power of the original.

Small and medium pieces of material may be joined together into a larger piece 
by performing the use command while holding both smaller pieces (eg 'ru' while 
holding two small wolfskin pelts).  Both smaller pieces must have exactly the 
same magical type and rarity, and their age power will be averaged.
