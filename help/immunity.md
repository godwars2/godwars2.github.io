Your immunity is applied after your armour (see 'help armour'), and works much
like another layer of armour except that it cannot by bypassed.

If you have immunity bonuses from multiple sources, they will all be added 
together, but the total cannot exceed 95% unless an ability explicitly states
otherwise (for example Elemental Scion or Shadow Infusion).
