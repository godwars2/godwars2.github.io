Once you've classed, it is recommended that you read 'help boost', and use 
either the casual or hardcore boosts to increase the amount of primal you earn.

In order to earn decent amounts of primal you should type 'shift' to transport 
yourself to the Nexus.  Be aware that there are no PK restrictions within the 
Nexus, and many players will be able to sense your arrival if you shift near 
them.  Thus it is recommended that you do not shift near Glyphstone Village.

You can use the 'area' command to locate terrain within the Nexus, and 'scan' 
to view task entry points.  Each new area you explore will earn you 100 primal,
and many of these areas will also unlock new tasks (type 'tasks' to list them).

As the primal you earn from kills is based on your age relative to that of your
opponent, the most efficient way to earn primal is to raise your potential to 
100% before you train any stats (because you'll be stronger for your age).  You
should spend primal as soon as possible, because although you lose primal for 
being killed, you cannot lose primal that you've already spent.
