This command is designed to stop you from both moving and fighting.  It will 
stop you from performing any location-based actions with your left or right 
hand, and will stop your legs from performing any movement-based techniques 
such as walking or jogging (although it will not stop jumps, ducks or kicks).

This command also clears any stacked-up commands in your command queue.

Note that you may specifically choose to just clear your left hand, right 
hand, feet or head by typing 'stop l', 'stop r', 'stop f' or 'stop h' 
respectively.  You may also use the shortcuts 'l!', 'r!', 'f!' and 'h!'.
