When your character successfully defends against an attack, it takes some time 
before that defence can be used again - this is called 'cooldown'.  For your 
feet (or unarmed attacks) this cooldown is between 4 and 7 seconds, depending 
on your encumbrance (4 for unencumbered, 5 for light, 6 for medium and 7 for 
heavy).  For a weapon it varies depending on the weapon type, but encumbrance 
is also a factor - you can find out the cooldown time for a weapon by looking 
at it.  Note that the weapon in your off-hand will also have +1 cooldown.

The cooldown timer won't go down while a combat technique is in its delay 
period and waiting to be performed (although it can still parry or block while 
being used to perform a technique - only the recovery time is delayed).

While wielding a weapon two handed, the assisting hand will automatically be 
used to help the cooldown timer for the other hand.  Thus the cooldown for a 
two-handed weapon will be half the normal time, or normal time while performing
techniques.
