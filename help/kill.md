In many muds, combat consists of little more than typing 'kill' and sitting 
back to watch the show.  In order to provide a gentler introduction to players
from such muds, a similar command has been made available here.  To begin 
automated combat, type 'kill' followed by the target's name - they will 
automatically be targeted if they are not already (see 'help target).  Your 
automated attacks will continue until either you or your opponent are dead, 
although you may turn them off before that point by typing 'kill' on its own, 
or by entering a manual combat command (see 'help combat').  During automated 
combat your right hand is used to make attacks while your left hand is used to 
defend - so make sure your best defensive weapon is in your left hand!

You may also perform certain actions with your feet during automated combat, 
using the 'advance', 'retreat', 'jump', 'duck' and 'kick' commands, or select a
fighting stance via the 'stance' command (see 'help stance').

Please note that automated combat is only designed to be a simple front-end for
newbies, and is vastly inferior to the manual system (see 'help combat').  Do 
not expect to win any challenging fights with it.
