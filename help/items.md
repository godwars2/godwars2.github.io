Magical items come in any combination of five types and three rarities.  The 
types are magical, legendary, mythical, relic and artifact, and depend on the 
age of the monster they drop from.  The rarities are common, uncommon and rare,
and these drop 89%, 10% and 1% of the time respectively (regardless of type).

A common magical item will have 1-2 bonuses.  Each type beyond magical will 
increase the number of bonuses by 1, and each rarity beyond common increases 
the number of bonuses by 2.  Thus a rare artifact will have 9-10 bonuses.

The actual bonuses will be randomly generated depending on the item, and to a 
lesser extent the material and type.  Some bonuses can be applied multiple 
times, others only once.  Some items (eg fangs) may only allow a single bonus.

The radiation is calculated by adding up the bonus costs (every bonus has its 
own cost).  Each bonus beyond the first reduces the radiation by 5%, up to a 
maximum of 25%, and each bonus beyond that reduces the radiation by 2%.  Each 
type beyond magical reduces the radiation by 2% and each rarity beyond common 
reduces the radiation by 5%.  The mud then randomly applies an extra modifier 
between -5% and +5%.  The total radiation cannot be below 50% of the base.
