Magical items come in any combination of five types and three rarities.  The 
types are **magical**, **legendary**, **mythical**, **relic** and **artifact**, and depend on the 
age of the monster they drop from.  The rarities are **common**, **uncommon** and **rare**,
and these drop 89%, 10% and 1% of the time respectively (regardless of type).

A common magical item will have 1-2 bonuses.  Each type beyond magical will 
increase the number of bonuses by 1, and each rarity beyond common increases 
the number of bonuses by 2.  Thus a rare artifact will have 9-10 bonuses.

The actual bonuses will be randomly generated depending on the item, and to a 
lesser extent the material and type.  Some bonuses can be applied multiple 
times, others only once.  Some items (eg fangs) may only allow a single bonus.

The radiation is calculated by adding up the bonus costs (every bonus has its 
own cost).  Each bonus beyond the first reduces the radiation by 5%, up to a 
maximum of 25%, and each bonus beyond that reduces the radiation by 2%.  Each 
type beyond magical reduces the radiation by 2% and each rarity beyond common 
reduces the radiation by 5%.  The mud then randomly applies an extra modifier 
between -5% and +5%.  The total radiation cannot be below 50% of the base.
