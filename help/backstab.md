If you have the Assassin Training talent, you gain the ability to backstab or 
throatslit your opponents while standing behind them.  To do this, you first 
need to know which direction your opponent is facing by typing 'display $o', or
by adding '$o' to your prompt.

An easy way to get behind your opponent is to move two feet opposite to the 
direction they are facing, then type either 'rs' (right slash) to slit their 
throat, or 'rt' (right thrust) to backstab them. If you have the Mighty Blow 
talent you can enhance your attack by adding a '+' (i.e., 'rs+' or 'rt+').

Another option is to circle around your opponent with the 'fl' (feet left) and 
'fr' (feet right) commands.  You automatically stop once you're behind them.

You can also check whether an opponent can be backstabed by typing 'display $B'
or by setting your backstab colour (see 'help colour').  Remember, in order to 
backstab or throatslit an opponent you must also have the weapon mastery talent
for the weapon you're using (see 'help Assassin Training').

Note that you can always perform a backstab on someone who can't see you, even 
if you're not technically behind them.
