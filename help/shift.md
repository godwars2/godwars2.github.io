  - shift

This command allows you to shift between the Realm plane and the Nexus.  The
process takes 9 seconds when travelling from the Realm, or 30 seconds from the 
Nexus, and cannot be performed while your adrenaline rush is active.  If it 
becomes active while you are in the process of using this ability, your planar 
shift will be interrupted.  You may also choose to interrupt the planar shift 
at any time by typing 'shift' before the process is complete.

Note that this command will only work when you are in the material plane, and 
will not change your coordinate position.  When your shift is complete, those
with supernatural senses may detect the power surge of your arrival, although 
this will depend on how powerful their senses are and how far away from them 
you appear.
