This command displays important information about your character.  The first 
section contains your name, status, played time and creation date.  If you're 
classed it'll show your Divine Age and your Potential (% of powers trained).

The second section contains your encumbrance (see 'help encumbrance'), primal, 
kills and deaths.

The third section lists your primary stats (see 'help stats'), which are used 
to calculate your secondary stats, and grant various other benefits.

The fourth section lists your Attack, Defence, Damage and Combat Queue for your
head, left hand, right hand and feet (represented by '(H)', '(L)', '(R)' and 
'(F)' respectively).  Note that your head location doesn't have a Defence, but 
instead has Protection, which works against mental attacks.

The fifth and final section lists your other attributes, including Speed, 
Resistance, Core Damage/Power, and so on.
