These commands allow you to open and close your eyes, or a specified object 
that you are wearing.  You can see if an object can be opened and closed by 
looking at it (there will be a 'Special' field in the top section).

While your eyes are closed, you cannot see your opponent, and will suffer the 
usual -50% Defence penalty for visibility (see 'help blind fighting').  Certain
powers, such as Ears of the Bat, may give you additional benefits while your 
eyes are closed.  You will also be immune to attacks which require eye contact,
and have half your normal natural armour on your eyes (instead of none).

If you are wearing a helmet with a lowered visor, you suffer a -25% penalty to 
your Defence, applied after pain modifiers.  If you have Blind Fighting, this 
penalty is reduced to -10% (representing reduced hearing).  However the lowered
visor will protect the eyes, and also doubles the helmet's face protection.
