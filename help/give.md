This command allows you to offer to give something you are carrying to another 
creature.  You must either specify the creature you wish to give it to, or 
target them first, and they must be standing within reach.  They then have 30 
seconds to accept, if they wish to take it from you.

You should use the optional word 'the' (listed in the syntax above) if you wish
to use multiple keywords for the first token.  For example if you want to give 
your gold collar to a black wolf you can type 'give wolf gold collar' or 'give 
collar black wolf', but not 'give black wolf gold collar' - instead you should 
type 'give black wolf the gold collar' (or 'give gold collar to black wolf').

Note that '@' is an alias for 'to' (and 'from' when accepting an object).
