There are no real rules here; just use your common sense.  If you're smart 
enough to learn how to play this mud, then I'm sure you're also more than 
smart enough to understand what result different actions have on the mud.

If you abuse bugs instead of reporting them, then the admin have to spend time 
tracking those bugs down instead of adding more game content for you to enjoy.

If you constantly harass other players, then the admin have to take time away 
from developing cool features so they can add ways to protect your victims.

If you repeatedly kill newbies, then they'll probably quit, giving you fewer
people to interact with and reducing your long-term enjoyment.  Newbies are 
like fruit: for maximum pleasure you should let them grow and ripen before 
plucking them from the branch and devouring their succulent flesh.

You can help make the mud a better place, or you can worsen it.  We hope you 
choose the former, and help us produce something that we can all enjoy.
