This command allows you to set the brackets that are placed around your 
pantheon title on the 'who' list.  Only the Supreme God of the pantheon can 
set the brackets, although they may be changed at any time.

The opening brackets must be two characters in length, and only certain 
characters are permitted.  The closing brackets are calculated automatically.
