In the War minigame, the order of attacks is randomised each turn.

Certain commands and recruits grant an ability called Initiative.  Those with 
Initiative always act before those without.

Note that the order is still randomised, so if two players have Initiative and 
another two don't, the first two will always act before the second two, but 
the order among the first two and second two will vary each turn.
