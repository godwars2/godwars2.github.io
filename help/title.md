This command allows you to set the title name for your pantheon, which then 
appears beside the names of your pantheon's deities on the 'who' list.  Only 
the Supreme God of the pantheon can set the title, and it only appears after 
it has been authorised by an admin.

If no title has been set (or authorised), your pantheon's name will use the 
default of 'Player's pantheon'.

Also note that no title will appear anywhere if your religion is based on 
monotheism.  This option is for players who have no interest in the concept 
of clans, but still want the benefits of bonus powers.
