layout: help
title: scan
syntax:
  - scan
---

This command shows you information about the surrounding terrain, a bit like 
typing 'look' on its own except that the map uses the same scale as the 'area' 
command.  Unlike the area command, however, scan will also show you subareas 
as well as task locations.
