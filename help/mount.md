This command allows your character to mount a horse or other creature capable 
of being ridden, providing you with the appropriate combat table for your feet 
and giving modifiers to certain weapon techniques.

Note that many weapons give bonuses when you are riding.  Techniques which are 
enhanced for riders are highlighted in green or yellow in the combat table.

You cannot ride a mount while shapechanged.
