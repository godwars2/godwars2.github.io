The config command allows you to customise certain aspects of the mud, such as 
the type of messages you get, which channels you can hear, whether your prompt 
is shown or not, and so on.  Typing 'config' on its own will list the options 
available, while 'config <option>' will toggle that particular setting on and 
off.  The config options are colour-coded to indicate if they have changed, or 
are set to their default (starting) value.
