Vampires have the ability to transform into alternative forms - a huge wolf, a 
cloud of bats, or a floating mist.  You cannot switch directly between these 
forms without passing through human form, unless you have 10 or more ranks in 
the Shapechanging power.

Each of your three forms has its own equipment and inventory set.  This is in 
fact a benefit, since each form has different equipment restrictions: as a 
wolf you can only wear collars, as a mist you can only wear items crafted from 
shadowcloth or shadowsteel, and as a cloud of bats you cannot wear anything at 
all.  If you transform into a giant bat (via the Chiroptera Blood Rune), you 
will be able to wear a collar and wing spikes, but will share your equipment 
and inventory set with that of your wolf form.

The most convenient way to move equipment between your forms is to use a store 
on your home plane (see 'help store').

To see which wear locations your current form has, type 'equipment slots'.
