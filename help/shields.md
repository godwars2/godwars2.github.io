Shields are specialised weapons which focus on defence.  They are also able to 
soak damage in much the same way as armour (see 'help armour').

Small shields only protect the hands and arms by default, but when wielded they
provide techniques for extending their protection to additional locations.  It 
is also possible to sheathe small shields.

Large shields protect a wide range of fixed locations, but cannot be sheathed.

The soak of a shield is halved during cooldown, or if the shield is currently 
performing a technique (if both are true, the soak is only halved once).  The 
Rapid Shield Block talent prevents this penalty from being applied.

If you are holding a shield in each hand, their soak is not combined.  Instead, 
only the highest soak for each particular location and damage type will apply.

Shields do not provide auto-absorb, unless they are sheathed.
