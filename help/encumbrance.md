Your encumbrance rating represents how much you are wearing, and affects you as
follows, colour-coded the same as the 'encumbrance' stat in your score:

Encumbrance | Encumbrance level | Speed modifier | Feet combat table | Colour
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Less than or equal to your Brawn | Unencumbered | +5 | Access to all feet techniques | CYAN
More than your Brawn | Light | +3 | Lose access to acrobatic techniques | BLUE
More than two times your Brawn | Medium | No modifier | Lose access to run and most kick techniques | MAGENTA
More than three times your Brawn | Heavy | -5 (or half, whichever is better) | Can no longer jog, kick, or jump | RED

Your encumbrance is also subtracted from your Defence rating for your feet, 
and affects how quickly your locations can recover from preventing an attack.
Note that Encumbrance 25+ means you're always at least lightly encumbered, and 
50+ means you're always at least at medium encumbrance, regardless of Brawn.

### Tips

- You only need 25 Brawn to get the minimum encumbrance level for the amount of encumbrance you are wearing.
- The Armour Proficiency talent partially negates one level of encumbrance penalties.
