Your encumbrance rating represents how much you are wearing, and affects you as
follows, colour-coded the same as the 'encumbrance' stat in your score:

Encumbrance is less than or equal to your Brawn: Unencumbered.  +5 Speed. 
You have access to all feet techniques.  Encumbrance coloured CYAN in your
score.  

Encumbrance is more than your Brawn: Light encumbrance.  +3 Speed.  Lose
access to acrobatic techniques.  Encumbrance coloured BLUE in your score.  

Encumbrance is more than two times your Brawn: Medium encumbrance.  No Speed
modifier.  Lose access to run and most kick techniques.  Encumbrance coloured
MAGENTA in your score.  

Encumbrance is more than three times your Brawn: Heavy encumbrance.  -5 Speed
(or half, whichever is better).  Can no longer jog, kick, or jump.  Encumbrance
coloured RED in your score.  

Your encumbrance is also subtracted from your Defence rating for your feet, 
and affects how quickly your locations can recover from preventing an attack.
Note that Encumbrance 25+ means you're always at least lightly encumbered, and 
50+ means you're always at least at medium encumbrance, regardless of Brawn.
