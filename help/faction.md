This command allows you to view and change your war faction, although you 
cannot change while already participating in a war.

The four suits have different commands and options for each faction, so you 
should be sure to read the military, religion, economy and diplomacy help 
files whenever you change to a new faction.

In addition, each faction has its own set of recruits.
