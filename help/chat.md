These commands broadcast your message to every player online.  If you don't 
specify a message, then you'll see the last 20 messages made on that channel, 
along with how long ago they were made.  The channels can be switched on and 
off by typing 'config chat' and 'config gossip' (see 'help config').

The chat channel is for civil conversations, as it is the channel that newbies 
are exposed to when they log on.  If your discussion is the sort of thing that 
will make people quit in disgust, it doesn't belong on chat.  If you refuse to 
remain civil, you may find yourself temporarily blocked from this channel.

The gossip channel is for discussing anything you wish, and is off by default.

Due to popular request, the . character has been added as an alias for 'chat'.
