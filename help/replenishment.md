You automatically replenish 0.5 mana per second, plus any bonuses from powers, 
spells or equipment, with your green magic applied as a percentage bonus to 
the end result (capped at 100%). During an adrenaline rush you replenish only 
half of this amount.

Unlike healing, mana replenishment is not affected by being struck in combat.
