This command allows you to view any special wounds you may be suffering from, 
along with a brief summary of any penalties they may give.  These cover a range
of different things, including physical wounds (such as lost limbs), sensory 
problems (such as blindness), emotional inflictions (such as temptation) and 
magical exhaustion (such as burnout).

All wounds are cleared when you die, or when you restore yourself on your home 
plane.  Some wounds (particularly the physical ones) may also be healed with 
certain class powers, such as Regeneration.
