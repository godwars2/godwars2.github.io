The original God Wars was created in 1995, and is based upon Merc 2.1 (by 
Mitchell Tse, Michael Chastain and Michael Quan) which in turn is based upon 
DikuMUD (by Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Hans Henrik Staerfeldt, Michael Seifert 
and Sebastian Hammer).  The God Wars code is available for public download, 
although no further work has been done on it since 1998.  God Wars itself 
eventually changed direction, being renamed to Dark City, then later to Last 
City, as it took a gradual turn towards RP in a World of Darkness setting.  
Sadly, development on Last City eventually ground to a halt in 2001.

God Wars II has been written from scratch, but draws upon many of the ideas 
and much of the inspiration of the original God Wars, as well as some of the 
technical concepts utilised in Last City and Gladiator Pits.  We wouldn't be 
where we are today were it not for the valuable lessons we learned from the 
past, and for that we extend our thanks to the Diku and Merc teams, as well 
as all those who contributed towards the original God Wars.
