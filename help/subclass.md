This command, when typed on its own, views your current subclass.  You may also
use list all available subclasses for your class, view a specific subclass, or 
customise your current subclass by raising and lower power bonuses.

When customising your subclass powers, you cannot raise any power above +2, +4 
or +6 (for age 200, 300 and 400 subclasses respectively), unless it was higher 
than that originally.  Nor may you have more than one power that isn't normally
granted by your subclass.

If your subclass gives a free talent, then you will always have that talent, 
regardless of whether or not you fulfill the requirements.  If it conflicts 
with one of your existing talents, you will lose the old talent.

If your subclass gives power bonuses, you must have at least 1 rank in the 
power before you will benefit from that bonus.  If you don't have any ranks 
then the bonus will be coloured red in 'subclass <subclass name>', and won't 
show a '+X' after your rank in the power when you type 'powers'.  The bonuses 
count as ranks, except for meeting the requirements to raise other powers.

Note that in order to train a subclass you must be at least age 200.  You will
not be able to rise above age 200 until you have trained your first subclass.
