The induct command allows you to invite another player to join your pantheon, 
and they can accept by typing 'ascend Player'.

The outcast command allows you to remove other players from your pantheon.

Note that only Lesser Gods and higher may induct or outcast, and you can only 
outcast those inducted by you unless you are a Supreme or Major God.  Outcast 
players are refunded all the soul points they've sacrificed, and the pantheon 
is refunded the cost (if any) for promoting that member.  If the pantheon has 
insuffient soul points to refund the player, then they cannot be outcast.
