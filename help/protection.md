Your character has three defence ratings - one for your left hand, one for your
right hand, and one for your feet.  You cannot defend with your head, however -
instead, it has a Protection rating.  This rating is calculated in the same way
as Ascendancy (see 'help ascendancy') and allows you to defend against indirect
spells in exactly the same way as Defence lets you defend against direct spells
and physical attacks (see 'help defence').  Note that the highest of your Blue 
and Green magic colours is used when calculating your Protection.

Unlike Defence, Protection does not suffer a cooldown (see 'help cooldown'), 
and therefore your mental defences will always be in perfect condition, barring
pain penalties.
