Magic works much like combat (see 'help combat'), and is available to those
with the appropriate talents.  Just like a combat table, you might have a spell
listed as 'sp', which means you can cast it with your right hand by typing 'rs'
followed by 'rp'.  The 'Asc' and 'Pow' columns represent Ascendancy and Power, 
which are the magical equivalent of Attack and Damage respectively.

Some spells also have a mana cost.  This is only used if you enhance the spell
by typing a '+' after the two-letter command.  For example, you could cast a 
zero-mana forcefield spell with your left hand by typing 'lo' - or instead cast
an enhanced forcefield by typing 'lo+' (assuming you've sufficient mana, and 
are not already affected by a forcefield spell).

Spells are also colour-coded - red is offensive, blue defensive, yellow is for
objects, green affects only the caster, and purple is for anything else.  Your
magic colour increases your Ascendancy like a weapon skill (with Meditate the 
equivalent of Combat) and the highest of your Blue and Green magic is used as 
bonus for Protection.  Your magic colour also provides a percentage bonus to 
the range, duration, bonuses, etc of each spell.
