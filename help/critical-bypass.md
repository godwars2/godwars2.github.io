When you inflict a critical hit, your bypass will be increased to reflect your 
blow striking a particularly vulnerable location.  You have a critical bypass 
of 150% by default - for example, if your bypass is normally +10, your critical
hit will actually have a total of +15 bypass (i.e., 150% of +10).

Some weapons have a critical bypass bonus for one of their commands, coloured 
cyan (along with the AP cost) at the top of the combat table.  Weapons with a 
critical bypass bonus will state how much bonus they give (+10% or +25%) within
their description.  This is added directly to the 150% base critical bypass, so
for example a rapier gives +25% critical bypass to all stab attacks, meaning 
that your critical stab attacks will have 175% of your regular bypass bonus.

Each combat technique may also provide an additional critical bypass bonus, 
depending on the colour-coding of its damage bonus: +20%, +10%, +5% or +0%.

Finally, certain Expert talents may also provide a critical bypass bonus (this 
will be described in the help file for each talent, if appropriate).  All of 
these bonuses are added together before being applied to your base bypass.
