This command allows you to change your gender - the Supernaturalis are never 
truly mortal, and can change gender at will.  Typing 'gender' on its own (while
on your home plane) will tell you whether you are currently male or female.

During the quickstart and concept character creation, your starting gender is 
chosen for you, to reduce the number of choices you need to make.  Some of the 
concepts give you a fixed starting gender (for example an amazon always starts 
female while a monk always starts male), while others have a random gender.

In the case of a random gender, the mud will analyse your name using pattern 
matching and a phonetic algorithm, comparing it with real names to choose your 
starting gender.  The name 'Player' sounds masculine (61% probability).

Note that this command is only available when you are on your home plane.
