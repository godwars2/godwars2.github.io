This allows you to send a private message to another player, regardless of 
distance.  This message is sent between accounts rather than characters.

If you type 'tell' on its own, you'll see the last 20 tells or replies that 
other people have sent you, along with how long ago they were sent.  You can 
also specify the number of tells you wish to see, for example 'tell 5' will 
display the last five tells you'd been sent
