The Supernaturalis do not grow old like mortals do, and the rules of time do 
not apply to them like they do to us.  A Supernaturalis 'ages' by focusing 
their innate Primal energy to strengthen their physical form, often reaching 
full maturity within minutes of being born.

An Imbued Supernaturalis is able to strengthen their form even further by 
absorbing primal energy from those they slay and then focusing it to train 
their attributes and raise their supernatural powers.

Your Age stat (also called 'Divine Age') is equal to the total of your Primary
stats, before magical adjustments.  Your Divine Age is 500.
