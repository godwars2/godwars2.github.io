The 'who' command will list which players are currently connected to the mud, 
with names colour-coded to indicate whether each player is in the outer Nexus,
the inner Nexus, a named Nexus area, a home plane (not necessarily their own) 
or somewhere else (such as the Realm, a dungeon, etc).  If you are classed, the
class names of other players in the Nexus will be colour-coded to indicate if 
they would or wouldn't give you primal, should you kill them.

Typing 'who brief' will list only the colour-coded player names, with a '*' 
indicating that the player is link-dead.

Typing 'who where' and 'who full' list where each player is located.

The 'whois' command allows you to view information about a specific player, 
such as when they last connected and how long they've played.  The 'finger' 
command is an alias for 'whois'.
