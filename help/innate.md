Titans gain various innate bonuses based on their total power ranks, regardless
of the actual distribution of those ranks, as follows:

1) +1 Speed per rank (up to 2*max rank) and half that bonus to Speed Cap.
2) +2 Attack and Defence per rank (up to 5*max rank).
3) +1 Damage and Resistance per rank (up to 5*max rank).
4) +1% Health per two ranks (up to 4*max rank).
5) +1% immunity vs all damage types per rank (up to 1*max rank).  30% max.
6) +1 physical bypass per rank (up to 3*max rank).
7) +1 energy and mental bypass per three ranks (up to 3*max rank).
8) +2% natural armour vs all damage types per rank (up to 4*max rank).

Note that if you are wearing armour, half of its soak will be subtracted from 
the above natural armour bonus, although this cannot reduce it below 0%.
