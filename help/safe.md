This command will show you whether or not you're currently safe from PK.  While
on your home plane you may also type 'safe off' to switch off safe mode.

If you are killed by another player and have at least 1 active boost remaining,
you will be safe from PK (Player Killing) until you quit, use your last active 
boost, or enter a magical node, task location or duelling arena.  The safety 
also vanishes after half an hour, or an hour if the death earned you primal.

If you are killed while you have 0 active boosts, you will remain vulnerable to
PK - typing 'boost' afterwards will not help.

Note that if you have safe mode on and have reached your primal cap, you don't 
earn any soul points for your kills.
