MSDP stands for MUD Server Data Protocol.  It allows the transparent sending 
and receiving of variables between the server and client, providing a useful 
tool for scripts and plugins.

MSDP is supported by MUSHCLIENT, allowing you to benefit from its features.

MSDP is also used by the official God Wars II plugin (see 'help gui').
