If you're using a screen reader, you should type 'config screen reader'.  This 
changes some of the tables to a more readable format, including the removal of 
dashed lines from the table displays.  It also unlocks a series of shortcut 
commands for quickly displaying specific information - type 'show' for a full 
list of all available shortcut commands.

Should you require further shortcuts, you can use the 'alias' command to set 
your own.  For example 'alias add age display Current age is {*age*}' will 
create an 'age' command for displaying your current age.

Depending on your client, you will probably want to switch off your prompt as 
well.  You can do this by typing 'config prompt'.  You can still set a prompt
and type 'prompt' to view it, much like the previously mentioned shortcuts.

You can view combat tables in a screen reader friendly format by adding the 
word 'long' after the two letter command, eg 'r? long', 'l? long', etc.

Colour can be switched off by typing 'colour off', while the amount of combat 
spam can be reduced by typing 'config combat spam', 'combat defence spam' and 
'config technique spam'.
