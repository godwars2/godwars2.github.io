This command displays the warboard - a scoreboard listing the top 10 Great War
players of the week (see 'help great war').  It will also indicate if you 
have not yet fought a war today.

The warboard only counts your first Great War of the day.  If you quit before 
turn 1 begins, it won't count, but if you quit after turn 1 has begun you will
earn no points for that particular day.

Your score is based on your Glory, with your Kills used as a tie-breaker.
