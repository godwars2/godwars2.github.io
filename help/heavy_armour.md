title: heavy armour
---

Certain talents and powers provide bonuses for heavy armour.  If you look at 
an item, it'll tell you whether or not it's classified as heavy armour, but 
the following is a complete list:

Head  : Full helm (also protects face and neck, but blocks spiked collar).
Neck  : Spiked collar, braided collar (epic) and torc of eternal health (epic).
Body  : Breastplate (also protects the back).
Groin : Codpiece.
Arms  : Bracers, battle bracers (also protects hands) and runic bracers (epic).
Hands : Gauntlets (not usable by Demon Form, so use battle bracers instead).
Legs  : Greaves.
Feet  : Boots (not usable by Demon Form).
Wings : Wing-spikes and barbed wing-spikes (epic).  Not for human form.

Dragons instead have a champron on their head, a criniere on their neck, a 
peytral on their chest, flanchards or reinforced flanchards on their flanks 
and a croupiere on their hind quarters.  Their dragonspurs are also treated 
as heavy armour, as are their wing-spikes (as listed above).

Draconians wear the same as humans, except they must wear a champron instead 
of a full helm, and they can also wear dragonspurs and wing-spikes.
