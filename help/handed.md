This command allows you to view or change your primary hand.  Your other hand 
(i.e., your off-hand) suffers a +1 cooldown penalty (see 'help cooldown'), and
any commands performed with it cost an extra five action points and take an 
extra second to execute.  The 'Delay' column for your off-hand will have its 
entries coloured MAGENTA to indicate the 1 second penalty.

If you have the Ambidextrous talent, you don't have an off-hand.

Note that this command is only available when you are on your home plane.
