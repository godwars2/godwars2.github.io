God Wars II uses imperial units to measure lengths and distances.  This was 
partly done because it seemed more appropriate than metric for a non-modern 
setting, but also because one foot was considered a nicer unit than one metre 
when it comes to measuring the reach of a weapon (particularly a melee weapon).

The smallest unit of measurement is a foot, which is approximately 30 cm.  3 
feet make a yard, which is slightly under 1 metre.  22 yards (or 66 feet) make 
a chain, which is approximately 20 metres.  10 chains (or 220 yards/660 feet) 
make a furlong, which is approximately 200 metres.  8 furlongs (or 80 chains/ 
1760 yards/5280 feet) make a mile, which is approximately 1.6 kilometres.
