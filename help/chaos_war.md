Admin will sometimes initiate a Chaos War.  A Chaos War is played in much the 
same way as a planar war (see 'help war'), except each turn lasts only 30 
seconds, and you cannot attack the God or another player until all 40 Lords of 
War have been eliminated.  Note that the Lords will also attack each other.

In a Chaos War, each participant except for the God may be targeted by only one
attacker each turn.  The first person to initiate the attack will do so, while 
all other attempted attackers will be informed that the target is already being
attacked - they may then pick a different opponent as normal.

Every kill you make (either Lord or player) gives 1 recruit point, which can 
be used to recruit special individuals - see 'help recruit'.

If you survive the Chaos War, you earn 1 point of Fame and Glory.  You earn an 
extra point if you also kill one or more Lords, and a third point if you kill 
the God.  If you die, you gain nothing, even if you killed a Lord or the God.
