Do you sometimes find yourself wondering 'What should I do now?'.

If so, the answer is simple - type 'what'.

You can type 'what' at any time.  It will give you a suggestion for what you 
can do next - you don't have to follow the suggestion of course, but if you're 
not really sure what to do it can point you in the right direction.
