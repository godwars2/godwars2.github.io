This command is only available once you have become Anointed (which requires 
completing a special task), and allows you to found a religion.  By default 
your religion will be based on monotheism, but you can change to polytheism 
by typing 'pantheon upgrade' (see 'help pantheon' for more details).

You may use the 'spheres' command to specify a sphere of influence for your 
new religion, and the 'pantheon' command to select a corresponding power.

It costs 100000 soul points to found a religion.  If you wish to join another 
pantheon, you must first leave your own by typing 'pantheon leave'.  You 
must outcast all existing members first, and you will be refunded all soul 
points you invested.  Should you 'found' your religion again, it will be in 
the same state you left it.
