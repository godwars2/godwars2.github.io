This command allows you to summon an equipment store from the ground.  You have
10 separate stores, and each can hold up to 25 items.  Enter the store, drop 
the items you want to keep inside, and they'll automatically save for the next
time you visit.

You may only have one store summoned at any one time, but it will vanish after
a while if there are no players inside it (this may take up to 30 seconds).
