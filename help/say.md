This command allows your character to speak out loud.  You will be heard by 
everyone within 1000 feet (although it will not carry outside your current 
location).  You may also choose to direct your speech at a specific person, by
typing 'to <their name>' before the text ('@' also works instead of 'to').

Note that if you place a smiley at the end of your spoken text, it will add an
emote to your 'say' message.  This smiley can be one of: ':)' (smile), ';)' 
(wink), ':P' (grin), ':D' (laugh), ':>' (giggle), ':(' (frown), ':O' (gasp), 
':o' (sigh), ':*' (snort), ':}' (chuckle), ':/' (grimace), ':x' (whistle), ':{'
(pout), ':\' (sneer), ':]' (smirk), ':[' (scowl), ':X' (snarl) or ':#' (groan).

You may also prefix the text with '+' for affirmative (a nod of the head), '-'
for negative (a shake of the head), '%' for rolling your eyes, '^' to raise an
eyebrow or '~' to shrug your shoulders.  Eg try typing 'say +I understand! :)'.

Due to popular request, the ' character has been added as an alias for 'say'.
