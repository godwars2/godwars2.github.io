This command shows information about your boosts and auto-advance.  Typing 
'boost casual' costs 0.5 boost points and gives triple primal for your next 10
kills.  Typing 'boost hardcore' costs 0.25 boost points and gives double primal
for your next 10 kills.  Typing 'boost skills' costs 0.50 boost points and 
gives you 10 skill boosts (see 'help autoadvance' to see how they work).

You earn 2.5 boost points each day you log on, minus 0.01 for every non-boosted
kill you made the previous day (so 2.49 if you killed 1 mob the previous day, 
2.48 if you killed 2 mobs, 2.0 if you killed 50 mobs, etc).  If you don't log 
on for several days, you will not get any boosts for the days you missed.

Every kill beyond 250 that you earn on a particular day will be added to your 
Age for the purposes of calculating primal for kills, and will also be carried 
over to the next day (eg if you get 300 daily kills, you'll start the next day 
with 50).  Mobs which give 0 primal don't count towards this limit unless they 
are newbie training mobs (which count as 2 kills).  Some tasks reward you with 
kill buffer points - daily kills beyond 250 are absorbed by this buffer.

If you make a boosted kill, the chance of the item drop being rare or uncommon 
is triple, or double if it's a piece of craftable material.  See 'help items'.
