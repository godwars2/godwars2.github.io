This command broadcasts your message to every deity in your pantheon who is 
currently online.  If you don't specify a message, then you'll see the last 
20 messages made, along with how long ago they were made.  The channel can be 
switched on and off by typing 'config pray' (see 'help config').

Note that this command is only available if you belong to a pantheon.
