Whenever an Imbued Supernaturalis kills another being, he will absorb primal 
energy from the victim.  When one Supernaturalis kills another, only excess 
energy can be taken in this way, but against other beings the entire essence 
of the creature is consumed.  Once the primal energy is stripped away, the 
remaining soul is retained as a form of supernatural currency, referred to 
as Soul Points.  These Soul Points can be exchanged or traded, or used to 
fuel magical devices.  They may also be "reincarnated" into new bodies in 
order to better serve their owner.
