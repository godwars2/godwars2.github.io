The invite command only works within your home plane.  It allows you to invite
another player to join you within your home plane, which they can accept by  
typing 'join Player'.

The banish command allows you to get rid of guests who have outstayed their 
welcome, sending them back to their own home plane.  This will also work on 
people who are in your stores, and you don't need to be able to see the 
person you banish.
