Your action points, sometimes called AP (and referred to as 'Actions' in your 
score) are an abstract way of reflecting how fast you can fight.  Each second 
you gain a number of action points equal to your Speed, although this cannot 
exceed your speed cap.  You then spend these action points to perform various 
combat techniques, eat food, rewield disarmed weapons, and so on.

Your maximum action points are 800, plus 20 for each point of Speed.  Your true
Speed stat (before the cap) is used when calculating this maximum.

If you enter a rage (for example via Berserker Rage, or a class power) and your
maximum number of action points increases, your current action points will also
increase by the same amount.  These extra action points will vanish when the 
rage ends, unless doing so would take you below 0.

If your action points fall below 0, you become fatigued (see 'help fatigue').
