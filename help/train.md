  - train subclass <subclass>
  - train reroll

This command allows you to train 6 of your 8 primary stats - Brawn, Grace, 
Mettle, Wits, Tenacity and Discipline (Size and Aura cannot be trained).  
Every time you train a stat, the mud will randomly train another stat for 
you, based on your subclass.

You may also use the train command to select a subclass (see 'help subclass') 
and to reroll your stats.  The latter will clear your subclass and talents, as
well as your trained stats and powers, and give you a corresponding number of 
free stat and power trains - but it can only be done once per calendar month.
