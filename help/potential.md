Every imbued Supernaturalis has access to number of powers (see 'help powers').
The maximum number of ranks you may have divided among your powers is equal to 
your Age squared, divided by 1000, with your three highest ranked powers not 
counting towards the total.  The maximum rank you may have in any one power is 
equal to 10% of your Age.

This means that a newly classed character at Age 100 can have 3 powers at rank 
10, and an additional 10 ranks distributed as desired.  An Age 200 character 
can have 3 powers at rank 20, and an additional 40 distributed ranks.  An Age 
300 character can have 3 powers at rank 30, and an additional 90 distributed 
ranks.  And so on.

Your 'potential' (as listed in your score, assuming you're classed) represents 
what percentage of your maximum ranks you've trained.  Thus 100% potential for 
an Age 100 character means they have 3 powers at rank 10, and an additional 10 
ranks divided among their other powers.
