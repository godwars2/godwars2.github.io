title: counter-attack
---

Many weapons have some sort of counter-attack, usually in the form of a 'ddd' 
technique (eg 'rd', 'rd', 'rd' to perform right handed).  These counter-attacks
operate exactly like defensive techniques, except that when you successfully 
defend they follow up with an attack.

This follow-up attack is usually automatic, except for swordbreakers and tiger 
claws, which give you 5 seconds to choose a response - allowing you to disarm 
your opponent, break their weapon, or perform an attack.  A main gauche also 
has the ability to lock the weapons it parries, which freezes the main gauche 
and the attacking weapon for 5 seconds (very useful vs two-handed weapons).

A counter-attack can only be dodged, or blocked by shields.  After execution 
it will need to be reset, although it still provides a regular defence.

It's important to remember that the counter-attack waits until triggered by a 
successful block or parry, so after setting it up you shouldn't perform any 
other commands with that location or you'll lose the counter-attack.
