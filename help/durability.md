title: durability
---

Every piece of equipment has both condition and durability.  Condition works 
like health and is based on item type, while durability works like immunity 
and is based on material type (although it can also be improved as a magic 
item bonus, up to a maximum of 99%).

Magic items automatically repair damaged condition at the rate of 1-5 points 
per second based on their type: 1 for magical, 2 for legendary, 3 for mythical,
4 for relics and 5 for artifacts.  Corrosion can reduce this by up to 4, and if
the item is reduced to 0 condition it will no longer repair itself at all.  To 
fix a broken item you will need to type 'repair' while on your home plane.

Note that corrosion can reduce the durability of an item by up to 10, while 
heat can reduce the durability by up to 6.  This penalty is applied after 
the durability bonuses is capped at 99%, so that a very rusty white-hot sword 
can never have more than 99-10-6=83% durability.
