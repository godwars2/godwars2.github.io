This command displays a small-scale map of the surrounding world.  Every two 
characters represents 660x660 feet (660 feet is 1 furlong, while 66 feet is 
1 chain), which is slightly larger than is displayed in the large-scale map 
you see when typing 'look' - for example the starting settlement, which is 1 
square furlong in size, appears as '[]' on the area map.

Note that your current location is displayed as '><' in the centre of the map.
You'll also see '@@' for oceans, '~~' for rivers and lakes, '::' for grassy 
plains, '::' for mountains, '^^' for forests, '::' for beaches, deserts and 
swamps, and so on.  You may also see '*' for a volcano or '*' for a pond or 
oasis.  In particular you should look out for 'o', which represents a monster 
lair, and is therefore a source of magical treasure.

You may also type 'area list' to list all available areas, and 'area <name>' to
view information about a specific area, including difficulty.
