This allows you to target something in the world.  This target is then used to
allow relative movement such as advancing and retreating, as well as being used
as an 'opponent' in combat.

You may also use this command to target a specific x/y coordinate location 
in the world.

Note that if you are currently moving towards a specific coordinate location, 
that destination will be lost in favour of the new target.
