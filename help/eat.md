The Supernaturalis are not required to eat food, but they often find it useful
to do so because of the rapid speed at which their powerful metabolism can 
break it down, providing a boost to their natural healing.

When you eat a piece of food, it will usually take a few seconds to chew 
before being automatically swallowed.  Once swallowed it will instantly heal 
you of some damage and your stomach will start trying to digest it to make 
space for more food.  If you try to eat too much too quickly, you'll become 
stuffed and have to wait for your digestive system to catch up.

Note that different types of food can be eaten and digested at different 
speeds, and provide variable amounts of healing.  If you wish to eat while 
your adrenaline rush is active, it will cost you one hundred action points.

Your speed is reduced by 1 when your stomach contains food, 2 if you're stuffed
or 3 if you're sick.  In addition, your cooldown suffers a +1 penalty while you
are eating (i.e., after typing 'eat' until you receive the 'swallow' message).
