title: leave
syntax:
  - leave
---

This command allows you to leave whatever you are currently inside of, if such
a possibility is available (for example it is not generally that easy to leave
a monster that has just eaten you).  For example typing 'leave' right now would
result in you attempting to leave Player's home plane.
