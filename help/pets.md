Various spells and powers will allow you to summon creatures to serve you.  You
may order these creatures to perform actions by directing a 'say' at them - for
example 'say to wolf follow me' or 'say to elemental kill goblin'.

Available orders are: Kill, stop, style, get, drop, give, accept, wear, remove,
perch, enter, leave, heal, follow, advance, north, south, east, west.

Note that 'stop' will stop the pet attacking.  The 'advance' command will cause
the pet to start moving faster, if it can.  Only specific creatures are able to
obey the heal and perch commands.

If you give the 'leave' order to a pet summoned with a spell, it will try to 
leave it's current location (just like a player).  If the pet was summoned with
a class power, the 'leave' command will make it vanish.

All pets have 'pet' as an extra keyword.  You may also address all of your pets
at once by typing 'say @pets <order>'.
