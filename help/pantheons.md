This command displays the pantheon scoreboard - a scoreboard listing the top 10
pantheons of the week, sorted in order of Karma.

If you've earned less Karma in the current week than you did the previous week,
the Karma in the scoreboard will be the average of the two weeks.  Otherwise it
will be the Karma you've earned the current week.  Thus you will usually begin 
the week with a certain amount of Karma on the scoreboard.

Your pantheon power gains a +2 bonus if your pantheon ended the previous week 
on rank 1-5, or a +1 bonus if it ended on rank 6-10.
