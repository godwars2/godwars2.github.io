This command allows your character to begin a task when standing within a task 
location in the Nexus.  To leave the quest you may type 'leave', or (when you 
complete it the first time) 'home'.

Note that tasks are instanced, meaning that if someone else begins the same 
task as you, they will have their own copy and cannot interfere with yours.
