This command is used to indicate to other players that you are AFK (Away From 
Keyboard).  An '*AFK*' tag will appear after your name on the who list and your
prompt will be changed to remind you that you have the flag switched on.

If someone send you a tell while you are AFK, the message will appear as normal
but they will also be informed (via a hint) that you may not respond.

Typing this command a second time switches it back off.

You may also specify an estimated AFK duration if you wish.  This is purely 
informative, and doesn't result in the flag being removed when the duration 
expires, nor does it prevent you switching it off earlier.

Alternatively, you may type 'afk semi' to indicate that you are semi-AFK 
(perhaps in another window) and thus may not respond very quickly.
