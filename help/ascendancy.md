Your Ascendancy rating for each location is calculated as follows:

1) Add together the stat modifiers.
2) Add any modifiers for the spell table.
3) Add any modifiers for magical items you're wearing.
4) Add Meditate and the spell colour, then apply them as a percentage.
5) Apply your style percentage, if any.
6) Add any modifiers for spell affects.
7) Apply any pain modifiers as a percentage.

Your Ascendancy is used instead of Attack when you cast spells, but your chance
to hit is worked out in exactly the same way (see 'help attack').  The only 
exception is for indirect spells, which use your opponent's Protection instead 
of Defence when determining whether or not your spell is successful.
