Health represents your maximum pain and damage threshold, and is calculated as 
follows:

1. 2 times Discipline + 4 times Brawn + 6 times Mettle + 8 times Size.
2. Add any Health bonuses from class powers.
3. Apply the +25% bonus for the Endurance talent, if you have it.
4. Apply the combined percentage bonuses from powers, spells and equipment.
5. Add any Health bonuses from magical items.
6. Apply your Athletics as a percentage (capped at +100%).
7. Add any points of Athletics over 100 as a flat bonus.
8. Add any Health bonuses from spells.

Note that if you have any bonuses to primary stats (from either spells or magic
items) then these are calculated prior to step 1.
