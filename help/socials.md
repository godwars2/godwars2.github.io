This command lists all available socials, optionally listing only those that
begin with a certain character sequence.  To perform a social, simply type the
name of the social as if it were a command - for example type 'smile' if you
wish Player to smile.  You may also specify a social type - for example 'smile
shyly' or 'smile coldly'.  If you do not explicitly specify a type, the default
for that particular social will be used.  To view the available types for a
particular social, type the social followed by 'types' - for example 'smile
types' to list the different types of smile.

You may also aim your socials at a specific person by using 'to' or '@'
followed by a target name.  In this case ordering is irrelevant - either 'grin
@Player evilly' or 'grin evilly @Player' are fine.
