During a Planar War or Great War, you have the option to recruit specialised 
individuals using recruit points.  You begin with 1 recruit point, and earn an
extra point every time you kill an opponent.

To view the available recruits along with their bonuses, type 'recruits' - 
the letter after the name represents the cost to purchase the recruit (eg 'M' 
costs 1 Military resource).  Some bonuses include both a Basic and an Expert 
bonus; you only get the Expert bonus if you already had the Basic bonus (eg 
Treasurer gives you the invest command, but if you already had that command 
you instead get +1 action per turn).

Type 'recruit <name>' to recruit the specified individual.  The recruit will 
remain in your service for the duration of the war, but vanishes along with 
any unused recruit points after the war has finished.

Note the 'treaty' command (granted by the Ambassadors recruit) can only be used
if your Offence and Defence each have 5 resources, and the former has a higher 
bonus than the latter.  Your Offence and Defence hands will be swapped, and you
will be unable to attack until next turn.  The person you target will also have
their own Offence and Defence hands swapped, and be unable to attack this turn.
