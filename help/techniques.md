Highlighted techniques are those granted by your current fighting style, while 
those coloured cyan are available because of the weapon in your other hand (see
'help assist'), and highlighted cyan means both.  Equally, yellow indicates a 
technique specific to your encumbrance (or because you're mounted) while green 
represents a combination of yellow and cyan.  Purple means the technique is 
available because of a talent you possess.

You should also be aware of the special characters; '*' is automatically added
whenever a technique requires you to act within a limited time frame (such as 
when jumping, or after catching an opponent's blade with your own), '-' means 
you are falling, '_' is added whenever you fall onto the ground, and '#' means
that you're entangled by something (such as a net).

As well as techniques, your combat table also colours other things - if the 
Delay is coloured red, that means it includes the penalty for your off-hand. 
Att(ack) is coloured to indicate its attack strength, just as Def(ence) is for 
defence strength and Dam(age) for its bypass bonus.  To see how these modifiers
are applied, and to learn what the attack and defence strengths mean, see 'help
attack', 'help defence' and 'help damage'.
