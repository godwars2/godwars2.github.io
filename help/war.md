There are infinite planes, but the Supernaturalis are not able to physically 
manifest on all of them.  On some planes you can only interact through visions 
and manipulation, achieving victory through your mortal worshippers.

To start a new war, type 'war start'.  To join a war type 'war <name>'.  Once 
the war has started, type 'war' on its own to see your resources.  Note that 
you must be on your home plane in order to play in a war (see 'help home').

Each turn lasts 60 seconds, and you have 3 actions.  These may be used for: 

Offence <resource>: Moves a resource to Offence, creates a new resource.
Defence <resource>: Moves a resource to Defence, creates a new resource.
Dismiss <resource>: Discards Offence/Defence/Resource (may also 'dismiss all').

Note that the resource is either the letter and number (M2, R4, etc) or just 
the number (2, 4, etc).  You may also spend an action to perform special 
activities, depending on your current Offence and Defence.

You may perform one combat action each turn (attack, jihad, mercenary or 
assassinate), but there is no restriction on the other commands.

Within a war, the scoring works a little bit like a poker game, as follows:

Having 5 of the same suit in ranked sequence is Perfect, and gives +10.
Having all 4 resources of the same rank is Superior, and gives +9.
Having 4 of the same suit in ranked sequence is Enhanced, and gives +8.
Having any 5 resources of the same suit is Focused, and gives +7.
Having 5 of mixed suits in ranked sequence is Straight, and gives +6.
Having 3 matching resources and 2 matching resources is Full, and gives +5.
Having 3 matching resources is a Triple and gives +4.
Having a pair of 2 matching resources is Forked, and gives +3.
Having 2 matching resources is Double, and gives +2.
Having any Offence or Defence at all is Basic, and gives +1.

Note that 'matching resources' can be either of the same rank (eg Military 5, 
Religion 5 and Economy 5) or in sequence within the same suit (eg Military 5, 
Military 6 and Military 7).  The rows and columns are counted separately, so 
for example Military 5, Military 6 and Religion 6 is Forked, giving +3.

If you have 3 or more of a particular suit, you gain a +1 bonus whenever it is 
used (eg 3+ Religion resources in Defence gives you +1 Defence vs Jihad).
