title: radiation

Magical items provide a source of power - but like all things magical, their 
power comes from the same primal energy that makes the Supernaturalis what they
are.  This results in an incompatibility, referred to as 'radiation', which
represents how much external magical power the Supernaturalis is able to bend 
to his or her will.

In game terms, each character may wear as much radiation as their Age times 10,
and it is not possible to exceed this maximum - attempting to wear further 
equipment is like trying to press together two opposing magnets.
