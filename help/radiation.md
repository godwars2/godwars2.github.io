Magical items provide a source of power - but like all things magical, their 
power comes from the same primal energy that makes the Supernaturalis what they
are.  This results in an incompatibility, referred to as 'radiation', which
represents how much external magical power the Supernaturalis is able to bend 
to his or her will.

In game terms, each character may wear as much radiation as their Age times 10,
and it is not possible to exceed this maximum - attempting to wear further 
equipment is like trying to press together two opposing magnets.

### Radiation cost

Radiation is either intrinsic in dropped or crafted items, or derived from powers such as Enchantment or Infernal Forging. Each type of magical bonus has a base cost, a summary of which appears below. The base costs are used in generating the radiation of dropped/crafted items, with a somewhat random discount (see items).

The Enchantment power also generates this level of radiation for each item bonus granted by it, though it does not apply a radiation discount. For this reason, dropped/crafted items are usually more efficient than Enchanted items.

Discount, and therefore efficiency, increases with better item types (from Magical up to Artifact) and better rarity (from Common up to Rare).
