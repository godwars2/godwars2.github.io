If you have any feedback or suggestions, or simply wish to exchange tactics 
with other players, you can use the God Wars II discussion forums at:

   http://clanscw.brinkster.net/godwars

Both positive and negative feedback is welcome, as long as it is constructive.

You may also post a review at The Mud Connector (www.mudconnector.com) if 
you feel so inclined, but once again I would urge you to be constructive, and 
include both the positive and negative aspects of the mud.  But most important
of all, please be honest.
