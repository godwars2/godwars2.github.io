If you're looking for information on class powers, type 'help powers'.

Power represents the raw mental power of your character, and is calculated in 
five steps for each body location as follows:

1) Add together the stat modifiers.
2) Add any modifiers for the spell table.
3) Add any modifiers for magical items you're wearing.
4) Apply your style percentage, if any.
5) Add any modifiers for spell affects.

Your Power is used instead of Damage when you cast spells (both physical and 
mental).  The calculation is applied against Resistance in exactly the same 
way as Damage (see 'help damage'), using Core Power instead of Core Damage.
