This command will display the weapon used in the specified hand as if you had 
looked at it using 'look +<weapon name>'.  If you are not using a weapon, or 
are viewing your left or right hand, it will instead display the stats for the
specified location in the same format as it would a weapon.

Note that your appropriate weapon skill (uncapped, but not including Combat) is
applied as a multiplier to your wielded weapons' first 100 points in each of 
Attack, Defence and Damage.  The same applies to natural weapons.
