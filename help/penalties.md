title: penalties
---

Many weapons have minimum requirements for Brawn, Grace and Size.  Should you
not meet those requirements, you can still use the weapon, but you will suffer
a penalty to Attack/Defence/Damage equal to twice the bonus normally gained 
from that stat for every point below the requirement you are (with a maximum 
penalty of 3 times).  The penalties per stat are therefore as follows:

\- | -
--- | ---
Brawn | -0/-4/-8/-12 Damage, depending on penalty.
Grace | -0/-8/-16/-24 Attack and -0/-6/-12/-18 Defence, depending on penalty.
Size | -0/-4/-8/-12 Attack and -0/-2/-4/-6 Damage, depending on penalty.

Note that the above penalties are colour-coded the same as when you look at 
the weapon, and are applied to your character before percentage modifiers.
