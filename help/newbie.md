This is a basic introduction for new players.  Make sure you read the hints as 
well!  For a more detailed newbie guide, see: http://www.godwars2.org/guide.php

Type 'target practice grounds' then 'ff' (feet forwards).  When you arrive type
'enter practice grounds' and 'target dummy'.  Read 'help tutorial' to learn how
combat works, practicing your different fighting moves on the training dummy.

Once you've worked out the basics, type 'leave' to exit the practice grounds, 
then 'target prison' and 'ff' (feet forwards).  When you reach the prison, type
'enter prison', 'target prisoner', then use what you've learned; kill him.

When you're comfortable fighting someone who hits back, type 'leave' to get out
of the prison, then 'target dojo' and 'ff'.  When you arrive, type 'enter dojo'
and then type 'challenge' to fight a white-sash martial artist.  After killing 
him, wear the sash and 'challenge' again to fight a stronger martial artist.

Once you've earned your black sash, use the 'area' command to locate monster 
lairs (see 'help tasks').  You can also return to your home plane to change 
your character setup, or to fabricate some equipment.  Read 'help classes' 
for a summary of each class, and 'help classing' to learn how to join one.
