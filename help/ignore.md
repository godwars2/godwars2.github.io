syntax:
  - ignore
  - ignore <player>

This command allows you to ignore the specified player, meaning that you will 
no longer see anything they chat, and they will be unable to send you tells or 
replies, or invite you to their home plane.  Equally, you will be unable to 
send them tells.

If you're already ignoring the specified person, this command will remove them 
from your ignore list.

Typing 'ignore' on its own will show who you are currently ignoring.  Please 
note that you may only ignore up to twenty-five people at a time, and the 
ignore list does not save.

Adding a '*' after the person's name ignores all of their known alts as well.

To ignore everyone, use 'config chat' and 'config tell'.
