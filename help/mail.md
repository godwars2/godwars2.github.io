This command allows you to read and write mail.  Only classed players may send 
mail, but anyone can receive and read it.  Your inbox holds up to 25 messages.

When writing a mail, you should first specify the recipient/s (up to five) and 
subject.  It is generally easier to add paragraphs at a time, as these will 
format better, but you may also add individual lines if you prefer.

To get a feel for writing a message, try this:

```
1) mail write @Name This is a message to myself.
2) mail ++ This is a paragraph of text (write several lines).
3) mail ++ This is another paragraph of text (write a few more lines).
4) mail format
5) mail show
6) mail send
```
