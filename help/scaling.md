Many dragon powers use a system called 'scaling' for calculating their bonuses,
meaning that the first four ranks give a bigger bonus than the later points.

For example, the Fires of the Volcano power gives an immunity bonus of +5% for 
the first rank, +4% for the second rank, +3% for the third rank, +2% for the 
fourth rank and +1% for the fifth and later ranks.  This would be described as 
a +5/4/3/2/1 scaling bonus.
