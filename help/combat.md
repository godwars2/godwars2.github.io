Type 'l?' to view the combat table for your left hand.  At the top you'll see a
list of valid commands, each of which are one letter, followed by their AP cost
in brackets.  To perform one of these commands, type 'l' followed by the 
letter - for example, if one of the commands is 'd' (for defence), you can type
'ld' to perform a left-handed defence.

Below the commands you'll see a list of all of the techniques available to you.
To perform these techniques, you need to type the commands for that location in
the appropriate order - for example, if one of the techniques for your left
hand is 'fss', you should type 'lf', 'ls' and 'ls' as three separate commands.
This may well trigger other techniques on the way - for example if 'fs' is also
a listed technique, then you will perform that technique on your second command
and the 'fss' technique on your third, allowing powerful combination attacks.

Type 'r?', 'f?' and 'h?' to view the combat tables for your right hand, feet
and head respectively.  These work in exactly the same way as your left hand,
although each of your four locations will have its own combat table.
