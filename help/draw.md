This command allows you to draw the specified weapon from its sheathed 
location, placing it into your first available hand.  You may also choose 
to draw multiple weapons at the same time by providing the plural form of 
that weapon (eg 'draw knives' rather than 'draw knife') - if the weapon's 
singular and plural form are the same (eg a kris) then the mud will attempt 
to draw both.  You may also type 'draw all' to draw the first two sheathed 
weapons you're wearing, or 'draw *' to draw the first available weapon.

This command also allows you to unstrap a target shield from your back, or 
grip a buckler which was previously hanging loose on your arm.  While this 
is not really 'drawing' as such, it uses the same command for the sake of 
simplicity.
