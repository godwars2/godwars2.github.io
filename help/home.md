This command allows you to teleport back to your home plane from within the 
main world.  If you are already in your home plane, then it will move you 
back to the centre of the main world (i.e., the settlement).  Within your home
plane you may type 'repair' to repair your equipment, and 'restore self' to 
restore your health, mana and action points.  You may also 'slay' mobs, as 
well as 'invite' and 'banish' other players.  You also have a number of stores 
which you can summon from the ground, for keeping your spare equipment.

While on your home plane you may also 'fabricate' equipment from thin air.

You may view your home plane by typing 'area', and view your current tile by 
typing 'tile'.  You may also move an entire tile at a time by typing 'nn', 
'ss', 'ee' or 'ww' (optionally followed by the number of tiles you wish to 
move in that direction).
