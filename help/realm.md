The Realm plane is where you initially start, and consists of three main 
islands.  On the main island is Glyphstone village, which consists of a few 
buildings.  Outside of the village it is possible to encounter wild animals 
and the occasional monster, but for real challenges (and magical treasure) 
you should explore the monster lairs which dot the landscape.

There is also a graphical version of the map available on the website, which 
you can visit here: http://www.godwars2.org/realmplane.php

The Realm plane is non-PK, providing a reasonably safe way to explore, but 
once you're classed it probably won't offer you much of a challenge any more.
At this point you should use the 'shift' command to enter the Nexus.
