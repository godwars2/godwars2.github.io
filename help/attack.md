Your Attack rating for each location is calculated as follows:

1) Add together the stat modifiers and subtract any weapon penalties.
2) Add any modifiers for the weapon table and bonuses for the weapon itself.
3) Add any modifiers for magical items you're wearing.
4) Add Combat to your appropriate weapon skill, then apply as a percentage.
5) Apply your two-handed percentages modifier, if any.
6) Apply your style percentage, if any.
7) Add any modifiers for spell affects.
8) Apply any pain modifiers as a percentage.

Your percentage chance to hit is calculated by multiplying your Attack rating 
by 100, then dividing it by your Attack plus your opponent's Defence.  Note 
that there is always at least a 5% chance to hit, and a 5% chance to miss.

In your score, your attack for each location is colour-coded to indicate its 
current attack strength, representing what defence strength is needed to 
counter it - a shield or dodges, paired weapons, normal weapons or any (non-
attacks are indicated by a '-').  In addition, ethereal attacks can only be
stopped by a shield or dodges, or by an ethereal defence.
