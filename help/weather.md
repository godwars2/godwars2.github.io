This command, when typed outdoors, will display the surrounding weather 
patterns.  Each character represents 660x660 feet (one square furlong, or a 
single tile), and the 'X' in the centre represents your current tile.  The 
'@' represents a thunderstorm, 'O' represents rain, 'o' represents heavy 
clouds and '.' represents light clouds, while everything else is clear sky.
