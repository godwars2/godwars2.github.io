This command displays the list of currently available events.  There can be up 
to ten events running at any one time, and shortly after one is completed a 
new one will begin.

Event mobs give twice as much primal as regular mobs of the same age, and this 
bonus DOES stack with boost (i.e., killing an event mob with casual boost gives
you six times the normal amount of primal).

The chance of an event mob dropping a rare or uncommon item is tripled, or 
doubled if they drop craftable material.  This is the same improved drop bonus 
that is granted by boost, which means that the two do NOT stack.
