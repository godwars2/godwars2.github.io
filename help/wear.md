This command allows you to wear the specified thing, if possible.  You must 
be carrying the thing in order to do this.

If the item you're wearing is a weapon, then you can also specify an exact 
location for it, such as on your belt or forearm.  If you don't specify a 
location in this way then the default for that weapon type will be used.  
Note also that only tiny weapons can be strapped to your chest or forearm, 
only small (or tiny) weapons can be strapped on your leg and only medium (or 
smaller) weapons can be strapped to your belt.

You cannot wear something while you have an adrenaline rush.
