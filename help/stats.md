There are two types of stat: Primary and secondary.  Primary stats represent 
the strengths and weaknesses of each character, and are used to determine the 
secondary stats.  The primary stats determine the secondary stats as follows:

Brawn: +2 Damage, +1 Power, +1 Attack, +4 Health and +1 thrown range.
Grace: +4 Attack, +3 Defence, +1/3 Speed and +3 Ascendancy.
Mettle: +2 Resistance, +1 Defence, +3 Protection, +1 Mana and +6 Health.
Size: +1 Damage, +1 Resistance, +2 Attack, +2 Defence and +8 Health.
Wits: +4 Defence, +2/3 Speed, +1 Protection, +1 Ascendancy and +1 Power.
Tenacity: +4 Ascendancy, +3 Attack, +1 Power, +1 Damage and +1 Mana.
Discipline: +4 Protection, +2 Resistance, +2 Health, +1 Damage and +1 Mana.
Aura: +2 Power, +2 Ascendancy, +2 Protection, +3 Mana and +1 spell range.

Brawn is also used for encumbrance (see 'help encumbrance'), while every 3 
points of Size increases your reach by one foot and reduces your Defence by 2.

If you have a Size bonus from your subclass or stat training, and are in human 
form, this bonus is treated as Density instead of Size.  Density gives the same
bonuses as Size, except for the reach and the -2 Defence every 3 points.  It 
also doesn't effect your movement rate (see 'help rate') or weapon requirement 
penalties (see 'help penalties').
