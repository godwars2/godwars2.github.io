MSP stands for MUD Sound Protocol.  If you wish to use sound (and your client 
supports it), type 'config MSP' to activate it.  You then need to download 
the God Wars II soundpack, which was created by Oberon:

<http://www.godwars2.org/msp.php>

Download and unzip the file into the appropriate directory.  If you're using 
MUSHclient, create (and use) a C:\MUSHclient\msp directory.

While sound is active, you may type 'sound' to toggle different sounds.

Note that more sound files will be added in the near future, so suggestions 
are always welcome!

If you have trouble getting MSP to work, try reading this thread:
