A power is a special ability available to Supernaturalis of a certain class.
It cannot be increased through use, only by the expenditure of Primal.  Like 
talents, each character has a limited number of available powers.

You may have a number of points in your powers equal to your (Age*Age)/1000, 
however your three highest powers don't count towards this total.  Further, no
power may have more ranks than your Age/10 (rounded down).  Thus as an age 100
character you could have 3 powers at 10, and another 10 points distributed 
however you please.

To view your current powers, type 'powers'.  If a power is coloured red, then
you don't fulfill all of its requirements, and therefore cannot raise it at 
this time (type 'help <power name>' to view the requirements).

You may also lower a power while in your home plane.  The mud keeps track of 
powers you've lowered, and allows you to raise that number of new powers for 
no primal cost - so feel free to try out the different powers.
