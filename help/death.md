As a god, death holds little for you to fear.  Prior to classing, death will 
result in one of three possibilities: If you're in the dojo, your lifeforce 
will be unable to depart, and will therefore return to your body, causing you 
to return to life within about 10 seconds.  If you're within the realm, you'll 
awake in the land of the dead, where you can kill a lost soul to rematerialise 
in the material plane.  If you die anywhere else (such as a dungeon), you'll go
directly back to your home plane, where you should type 'repair' and 'restore',
and then 'home' to return to Glyphstone Village (see 'help home').

Once you've classed death can result in the loss of Primal.  The amount lost 
depends on your age: a killer of your own age will drain 100 Primal, while an 
older killer will drain less and a younger killer more.  If you have more than
50 daily kills, then every kill over 50 is added to your age for the purposes 
of calculating how much primal you lose when you die.
