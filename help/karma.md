If you belong to a pantheon, you will earn Karma while in the Nexus.  The 
amount of Karma earned is the same as the amount of Primal earned, minus your 
number of daily kills.  Once you've earned 1000 Karma, any further points are 
automatically transferred to your pantheon.  When you leave the Nexus (through
death, entering a task or shifting) then half of your current Karma will be 
transferred to your pantheon and the rest will be lost.

If you kill another player in the Nexus, they are old enough to give Primal, 
and both of you are in top 10 pantheons, then you will steal all Karma that 
they haven't yet transferred to their pantheon.  If you successfully steal 
any Karma from them, it will count as a pantheon kill.

Note that new recruits cannot earn Karma.  When someone joins a pantheon they 
remain a new recruit until the scoreboard resets at the end of the week.
