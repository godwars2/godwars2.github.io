At 11pm mud time (i.e., every 6 real-life hours) the God of War initiates a 
Great War.  At midnight mud time (i.e., 15 minutes later) the Lords of War 
join (1 for each player, up to a maximum of 40) and the Great War begins.

A Great War is played in the same way as a planar war (see 'help war'), except 
each turn lasts only 30 seconds, and you must kill two Lords before you can 
attack the God or another player (unless all the Lords are dead).  The maximum 
number of Lords who can attack you each turn is initially 2, +1 for every Lord 
or player you kill.  This maximum doesn't apply to players attacking you.

Every kill you make (either Lord or player) gives 1 recruit point, which can
be used to recruit special individuals - see 'help recruit'.

If you survive the Great War, you earn 1 point of Fame and Glory.  You earn an 
extra point if you also kill one or more Lords, and a third point if you kill 
the God.  If you die, you gain nothing, even if you killed a Lord or the God.
