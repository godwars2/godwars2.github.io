This command allows you to specify your pantheon's spheres of influence.  You 
may add a primary sphere for free, but the secondary sphere costs 100000 soul 
points, while the tertiary sphere costs 250000 soul points.

You may also swap your spheres for other spheres, but this may impact members 
of the pantheon if they are relying on the sphere you change.

Only the Supreme God of the pantheon can add or swap the spheres.
