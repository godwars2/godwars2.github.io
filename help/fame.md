Fame and Glory are earned from the Great War (see 'help great war').  They are 
earned at the same rate, but your Fame cannot exceed 10% of your Age and never 
goes down, while Glory has no maximum but goes down as it is spent.

You may use the 'epic' command to add your Glory points to your epic items and 
customise their bonuses, with each point of Glory adding 1 Fame, 25 radiation 
and 50 epic points to the item.  These epic points are then spent to add actual
bonuses.  Note that you can only use one epic item at a time, and cannot use or
create epic items that have a higher Fame rating than you.
