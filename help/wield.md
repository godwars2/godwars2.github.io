syntax:
  - wield <thing>

This command allows you to wield the specified thing in your hand, using it as 
a weapon, even if it is not intended to be used as such.  You must be carrying 
the thing in order to do this.

You cannot wield while you have an adrenaline rush.  The only exception is if
the item was disarmed, or lost due to having a body part chopped off - if this 
happens, you have 30 seconds during which you may rewield.  Doing so will cost 
1000 action points, -100 for every second you wait, to a minimum of 100 action 
points after 9 seconds.  Throwing a weapon doesn't count as a disarm, but if 
one of your hands is severed it can be rewielded as if it had been disarmed.

To use a weapon two-handed you must first wield it in one hand, then assist 
with the other (see 'help assist').
