  - look +<thing worn, or nearby>
  - look -<thing nearby>
  - look

This command shows you information about whatever you are looking at - the 
exact information depends on the thing itself.  For example, if you look at 
another player you will see their description and equipment, while looking 
at a weapon or piece of armour will show you what bonuses it grants.

If you place a '+' before the item you wish to look at, it will search your
worn equipment, otherwise it'll search your inventory.  In both cases it'll 
search the area around you if nothing was found on your person.

You may also place a '-' before the item you wish to look at, in which case
it will only look nearby, ignoring anything you are wearing or carrying.

Typing 'look' without any arguments will show you everything nearby, while
'look self will display your current description.
