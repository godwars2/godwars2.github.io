Buy and sell work much like give and accept, except they allow you to exchange
items for a specified price (see 'help soul points').  The offer to sell will 
remain open for 30 seconds.  You may also use the view command to see the stats
of the item being sold.

Note that '@' is an alias for 'to' (and 'from' when buying an object).
