  - display <text>

This command displays the text you enter back to you, with any variables 
entered converted to their appropriate values.  You may type 'display' on its 
own to get a list of the main variables (which are the same as those used by 
prompts).  There are also variables available which aren't listed, so if there 
is information you specifically want to display, please ask an admin.

This option was added originally for blind players, but other players may also 
find it useful, particularly when used as an alias.
