This command lists all of your currently available commands.  You may 
optionally choose to list only those that begin with a certain character 
sequence, for example 'commands s' or 'commands sh'.

If a command is highlighted in white, that means it is only available because 
you are currently mounted.  If a command is highlighted in cyan, then it has 
been granted by a talent or power, or by your class.
