These commands let you promote and demote other pantheon deities.  You cannot 
promote people to (or demote them from) your own rank or higher, and can only 
effect those you inducted unless you are a Major or Supreme God.  The ranks, 
with power bonuses and (total non-cumulative) promotion costs are as follows:

Rank | Bonuses
--- | ---
Supreme God | Gains a +3 power bonus.  The founder of the religion.
Major God   | Gains a +3 power bonus.  Costs 100000 soul points.
Greater God | Gains a +3 power bonus.  Costs 50000 soul points.
Lesser God  | Gains a +2 power bonus.  Costs 25000 soul points.
Minor God   | Gains a +2 power bonus.  Costs 10000 soul points.
Godling     | Gains a +1 power bonus.  Costs 5000 soul points.
Demigod     | Gains a +1 power bonus.  Costs 1000 soul points.
Immortal    | Gains a +0 power bonus.  Costs 0 soul points.

Note that the diety must have sacrificed enough soul points to cover their 
promotion cost, unless promoted by a Major or Supreme God.  The cost is paid 
by the pantheon, but is refunded if the player is later demoted or outcast.

In addition to the Supreme God, each pantheon may have a maximum of 15 deities 
at Minor God or higher, of which a maximum of 5 may be Greater God or higher.
