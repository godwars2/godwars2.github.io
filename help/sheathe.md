  - sheathe all
  - sheathe *
---


This command allows you to sheathe the specified weapon from your hand.  The 
weapon will be placed back in whichever sheathed location it came from, as 
long as that location isn't already taken by another weapon.  You may also 
choose to sheathe multiple weapons at the same time by providing the plural 
form of that weapon (eg 'sheathe knives' rather than 'sheathe knife') - if 
the weapon's singular and plural form are the same (eg a kris) then the mud 
will attempt to sheathe both.  You may also type 'sheathe all' to sheathe both 
of your held weapons, or 'sheathe *' to sheathe the first available weapon.

This command also allows you to strap a target shield to your back, or to hang
a buckler loose on your arm.  While this is not really 'sheathing 'as such, it
uses the same command for the sake of simplicity.
