This is a shortcut command designed to move your feet into a fighting stance 
appropriate for your current fighting style (see 'help style').  You may also
provide a style name as an argument, which will set your fighting style at 
the same time.

Note that this command will clear your feet location of any actions before 
moving you into a stance.  In addition, there may not always be a stance 
available, depending on the style you're using and the amount of encumbrance 
you're carrying.
