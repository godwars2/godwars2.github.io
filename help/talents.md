This command without any arguments displays your current talents, along with a 
summary of each, while 'talent list' shows all talents for which you qualify.

You may also type 'talent all' to show every talent, 'talent category <name>' 
to show all talents of a specified category, or 'talent <class name>' to show 
all talents of a specified class.  These three options colour-code the talents 
to indicate those you've got, those you do qualify for, and those you don't.

You may view the specific details of a talent by typing 'talent' or 'help' 
followed by the talent name - for example 'help mind over matter'.

You may add a talent to your character by typing 'talent add <talent name>', as
long as you have a free slot.  You start with three talent slots, and earn a 
fourth by mastering (i.e., getting to 100) five skills (any of core skills, 
weapons and magic).  You earn a fifth talent slot when you master your first 
super fighting style.  You also earn a free Weapon Mastery talent by mastering 
five weapon skills, a second Weapon Mastery talent by mastering eight weapon 
skills, and a third Weapon Mastery talent by mastering all ten weapon skills.

Classed characters also gain a new talent at age 100, another at age 200, etc.
