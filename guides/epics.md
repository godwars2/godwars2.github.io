## Epic Details

You may use the 'epic' command to add your Glory points to your epic items and
customise their bonuses, with each point of Glory adding 1 Fame, 25 radiation
and 50 epic points to the item.  These epic points are then spent to add actual
bonuses.  Note that you can only use one epic item at a time, and cannot use or
create epic items that have a higher Fame rating than you.
