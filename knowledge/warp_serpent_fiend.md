The serpent fiend is a vile and traitorous creature - traits which endear it 
greatly to the denizens of hell.

Using this warp on your head creates a crown of writhing snakes, which replaces
the damage type of your headbutt attack to poison.

Using this warp on your mouth changes your bite attack from crush damage to 
stab damage, and gives you a 5% chance per rank of injecting venom into your 
opponent whenever your bite attack achieves a critical success.

Using this warp on your skin changes the immunity, armour, auto-absorb and 
bypass you gain from Pathway to Hell from heat damage to poison damage.

Using this warp on your arms will leave you without arms.  Your left and right 
combat tables will provide additional dodge defences which get an extra +50 
Defence every 10 ranks.  Your head, feet and tail attacks also get +2 physical 
and +1 non-physical bypass per rank in each of Demon Form and Tainted Talons.

Using this warp on your legs will transform them into a serpent tail, allowing
you to ignore water currents and increasing your swimming rate by +1 per rank.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
chest or stomach, this scar gives +3% natural poison armour per rank.
