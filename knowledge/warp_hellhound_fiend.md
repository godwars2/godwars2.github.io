The hellhounds are the infernal guard dogs of hell.

Using this warp on your skin will make it extremely tough when exposed to the 
air.  Every unarmoured part of your body gains a natural armour of +1% vs all 
damage types for each rank you have in Demon Form, and +5% vs crush, +4% vs 
cut, +3% vs stab, +2% vs cold and shock, and +1% vs heat and poison, for each 
rank you have in Tainted Flesh.  You also gain +1 auto-absorb vs physical and 
half that vs other damage types for each rank in Tainted Flesh, and gain the 
Tainted Flesh immunity bonus if the location is unarmoured.

Using this warp on your arms will transform them into paws, providing you with 
an alternative unarmed combat table and giving them +1 cut bypass per rank.

Using this warp on your legs will transform your lower body into that of a huge
hellhound, providing you with an alternative feet combat table.

Using this warp on both your arms and legs will result in you transforming into
a hellhound.  This form gains all the benefits of Wolf Form, except using your 
Demon Form power to calculate the bonuses.  If you also have this warp on your 
skin, your Tainted Flesh will operate exactly like Lupine Fortitude.  If you 
have a different skin warp, the ranked armour bonuses will vary.  While in this
form, each rank in the Hellhound power will give you +1 bypass.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
ankles, this scar increases your riding movement speed by +1 per rank.
