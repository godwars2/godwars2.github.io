The chelonian fiend is a powerful and heavily armoured beast which roams the 
great fiery lakes of hell.

Using this warp on your skin will provide you with +1% natural crush armour per
rank to all locations.  In addition you will get +2 Resistance per rank instead
of the +1 Damage and +1 Resistance per rank that Demon Form usually gives.

Using this warp on your arms will improve your Rapid Shield Block talent, if 
you have it, increasing the 33% defence during cooldown by +1% per rank.  It 
also replaces your talons with powerful fingers which benefit from Iron Fists, 
but not Iron Talons or Razor Claws.  Powers such as Tainted Talons still help. 

Using this warp on your wings will replace them with a shell, increasing your
feet defence during cooldown by +1% per rank in Wings of the Abyss (on top of
the 33% base cooldown defence, or 50% if you have Instinctive Dodge - you gain
no benefit when using Enhanced Deflection).  You also lose short-range flight.

Using this warp on both your arms and wings gives you a 1% chance per rank of 
avoiding a hand-chopping critical hit, although you will still suffer damage 
from the blow, and your technique queue for that hand will be cleared.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
wrists, this scar improves your Rapid Shield block talent like the arms warp.  
Placed on your ankles, this scar improves your Instinctive Dodge like the wings
warp (unless your Warbeast has the wings warp, using your rank in Demonology.
