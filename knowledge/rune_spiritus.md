The Spiritus rune represents the dark nature of your vampiric soul.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour vs
mental damage per rank.  In addition, if you use the Cloak of Shadows power, 
the armour bonus it provides will also apply against mental damage.

When placed on your chest, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour and 
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs mental damage per rank.  If you also have 
Psionics, your first 10 ranks in this power will each give +1% mental immunity.

When placed on your hands, this rune allows you to drain away the lifeforce of 
your victims through your weapons, claws and fists,  Each time you inflict a 
critical hit with such an attack, there is a 5% chance per rank of causing a 
mental burst.  You also receive +1 bypass per rank for the mental burst.

When placed on your feet, this rune improves your mental resistance.  You gain 
+1% immunity to mental damage for each rank you have in Path of Shadows or 
Blood Runes, whichever is lower, up to a maximum of 20% immunity at rank 20.
