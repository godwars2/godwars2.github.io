The blight demon is a truly repulsive creature, reviled even by other demons.

Using this warp on your mouth gives you a powerful lashing tongue tipped with a
small mouth full of tiny razor-sharp fangs.  This alternative tongue-based bite
attack inflicts cut damage, gains +5' range, +2 attack and +2 damage per rank, 
and also has a 5% chance per rank of leaving toxic saliva in the wound on a 
critical hit (treated as a dual heat/poison burst attack).

Using this warp on your skin will increase your Size by 1 for every 5 ranks you
have in Demon Form, although you will lose the +1 Resistance/rank bonus.

Using this warp on your arms will cause you to grow two pairs, each ending in 
thin taloned hands, providing you with an alternative unarmed combat table.

Using this warp on your legs will transform your lower body into that of a huge
bloated maggot, providing you with an alternative feet combat table.

Using this warp on your wings will make your wingbash inflict poison damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, you will gain the Blight Demon's tongue instead of your bite attack.
