The Umbrage rune represents the shadows from which you were reborn.

When placed on your cheeks and using the Cloak of Shadows power, the armour 
bonus it provides will also apply against cold damage.  In addition, while 
wearing shadow crafted items you gain +1% immunity to all locations vs all 
damage types for every 500 points of shadow taint you're wearing.

When placed on your chest, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour and 
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs cold damage per rank.  In addition, while 
wearing shadow crafted items you gain +1% natural armour to all locations vs 
all damage types for every 50 points of shadow taint you're wearing.

When placed on your hands, this rune allows you to channel frost through your 
weapons, claws and fists.  Each time you inflict a critical hit with such an 
attack, there is a 5% chance per rank of frost spraying from your weapon, claws
or fists.  You also receive +1 bypass per rank for the cold burst.  If you are 
wearing shadow crafted items, you also gain +1 physical bypass per rank and +1 
physical bypass for every 100 points of shadow taint you're wearing.

When placed on your feet, this rune improves your ability to walk the shadows, 
increasing the strength of your Cloak of Shadows invisibility by +1 per rank.
