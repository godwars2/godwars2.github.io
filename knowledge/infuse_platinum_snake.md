This wisdom increases your control over platinum, one of the favoured materials
of dragonkind.

As a dragon, this wisdom increases your Treasure Hoard mental bypass by +1, but
only if it normally gives at least +2 bypass.  As a human, it allows you to use
Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting on platinum items.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom, with each 
counting as two platinum items for the purposes of Chameleonic Gift.  Used on 
your pattern, it counts as one platinum item.  Used on your mouth or horns, it 
gives them dual mental damage.  Used on your stomach, it gives mental breath.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on either forearm with this wisdom, giving both
arms +1 mental bypass per rank while raging, or +2 per rank if you also have 
Psionics.  If placed on both forearms, the bypass applies to all locations. 
When used on your forehead, you gain +1 Resistance per rank for each piece of 
heavy platinum armour you're wearing.
