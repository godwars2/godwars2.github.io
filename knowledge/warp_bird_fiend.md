The bird fiend is the bigger, meaner and more aggressive ancestor of the harpy.

Using this warp on your mouth will give you a hooked beak, changing your bite 
attack from crush damage to stab damage.

Using this warp on your skin will provide you with +1% natural stab armour per
rank to all locations.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1% stab bypass per rank to all attacks 
made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your legs will replace your hooves with clawed feet, causing
you to inflict stab damage instead of crush damage with your stamp attacks.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred location +1 stab bypass 
per rank, or +2 per rank if you have Pierce.  Placed on your chest or stomach,
this scar gives +5% natural stab armour per rank.
