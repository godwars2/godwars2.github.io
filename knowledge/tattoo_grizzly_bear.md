The grizzly bear is a large, fierce predator, with powerful muscles and claws.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo allows you to regenerate at twice the
normal speed while lying prone without an adrenaline rush, regardless of rank.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo provides you with +2% natural armour and
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs cut, stab and crush damage, per rank.

When placed on a forearm, this tattoo gives that hand +1 cut bypass per rank 
(both with and without weapons).  You also gain an additional +1 per rank in 
Greater Bear Spirit, although this cannot exceed your rank in Lunar Tattoos.

When placed on your shins, this tattoo allows you to move more quickly while 
raging.  When affected by Spirit of Fenris, you gain +1 movement rate per rank.
