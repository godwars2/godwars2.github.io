The Ember rune represents your inner struggle against the heat of the sun.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour vs
heat damage per rank.  In addition, if you use the Cloak of Shadows power, the 
armour bonus it provides will also apply against heat damage.

When placed on your chest, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour and 
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs heat damage per rank.

When placed on your hands, this rune allows you to channel fire through your 
weapons, claws and fists.  Each time you inflict a critical hit with such an 
attack, there is a 5% chance per rank of flames exploding from your weapon, 
claws or fists.  You also receive +1 bypass per rank for the fire burst.

When placed on your feet, this rune improves your ability to resist heat.  You 
gain +1% immunity to heat damage for each rank you have in Path of Shadows or 
Blood Runes, whichever is lower, up to a maximum of 20% immunity at rank 20.
