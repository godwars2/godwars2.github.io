The forest raven is a large and cunning bird, often considered a sign of ill 
omen.  It is also associated with intelligence, insight, trickery and magic.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo allows you to draw upon the power of 
your other tattoos to strengthen your Spiritshield spell.  If you're also using
a Mammoth tattoo it'll give your Spiritshield heat armour, while Rhino gives 
cold, Eel gives shock, and Cobra gives poison.  This bonus is +1% for each rank
you have in each of Ride the Storm and Greater Crow Spirit, and is part of the 
Spiritshield spell.  Multiples of the same tattoo give no additional benefit.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo gives you +1% natural armour per rank to
all locations against heat, cold and shock damage.  If you have Spirit Wolfkin,
this bonus is doubled to +2% armour per rank.

When placed on your forearms, this tattoo gives you +1 bypass for all heat, 
cold and shock damage spells you cast with that arm, per rank.  You don't gain 
this benefit from spells cast through wands or other magical devices.

When placed on your shins, this tattoo increases the range of your pounces by 
100 feet for every 10 ranks.  You will still pounce at 100 feet per second.
