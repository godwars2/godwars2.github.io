This wisdom increases your control over gold, one of the favoured materials of 
dragonkind.

As a dragon, this wisdom increases your Treasure Hoard heat bypass by +1, but 
only if it normally gives at least +2 bypass.  As a human, it allows you to use
Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting on gold items.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom, with each 
counting as two gold items for the purposes of Chameleonic Gift.  Used on your 
pattern, it counts as one gold item.  Used on your mouth or horns, it gives 
them dual heat damage.  Used on your stomach, it enhances your fire breath.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on either forearm with this wisdom, giving both
arms +1 heat bypass per rank while raging, or +2 per rank if you have Burn.  If
placed on both forearms, the bypass applies to all locations.  When used on 
your forehead, you gain +0.5 Damage and Power per rank for each piece of heavy 
gold armour you're wearing.
