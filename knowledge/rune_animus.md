The Animus rune represents your disposition and resolve.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune gives +1 bypass per rank for all attacks 
made with your head.  In Bat Form this applies to all attacking locations, as 
each of your bats uses its head to attack.

When placed on your chest, this rune gives +1 bypass per rank for all attacks, 
but ONLY if you haven't placed the Animus rune on any other locations.

When placed on your hands, this rune gives +1 bypass per rank for all attacks 
made with your hands, both with and without weapons.  This bonus does not apply
in Bat Form.

When placed on your feet, this rune gives +1 bypass per rank for all attacks 
made with your feet (including wings).  This bonus does not apply in Bat Form.
