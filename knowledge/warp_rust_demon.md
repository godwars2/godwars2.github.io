Rust demons are ghoulish creatures who haunt battlefields, devouring not only 
the fallen, but also their arms and armour.

Using this warp on your arms will cause your unarmed claw attacks to rust and 
tarnish your opponent's armour.  The higher your rank, the more corroded it 
will be by each of your blows, reducing its durability and magical self-repair.

Using this warp on your head, mouth, wings or legs will cause your headbutts, 
bites, wingbashes and stamp attacks to rust and tarnish your opponent's armour,
in exactly the same way as described above for the arms warp.

Using this warp on your skin gives you +4 Health per rank in Demon Form.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred locations with the same 
type of rust attacks as described above.
