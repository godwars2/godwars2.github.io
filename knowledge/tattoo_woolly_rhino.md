The woolly rhino is a large species of rhinoceros, named after the thick fur 
which protects it against the cold conditions in which it lives.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo gives you a 5% chance per rank of 
frost spraying from your fangs whenever your bite attack achieves a critical
success, as well as +1 cold bypass per rank for your bite attack.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo provides you with +3% natural armour and
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs cold damage, per rank.  If you have Arctic 
Wolfkin, your first 10 ranks in this power will each give +1% cold immunity.

When placed on a forearm, this tattoo gives you +1 cold bypass per rank for all
attacks made with that hand (both with and without weapons), and replaces the 
shock burst of Storm Talons with a cold burst (but just for that hand).

When placed on your shins, this tattoo gives you +2 attack and +2 bypass per 
rank to all feet attacks, including kick, stamp and pounce.
