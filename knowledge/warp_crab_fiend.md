The crab fiend is a ruthless and ravenous scavenger, always on the lookout for
something or someone to eat.

Using this warp on your head gives you a pair of antennae, which replaces your
headbutt attack with the ability to sense victims.

Using this warp on your skin makes it very tough, as long as you wear nothing 
over it.  Every unarmoured part of your body (except feet) gains a natural 
armour of +1% vs all damage types for each rank you have in Demon Form, and +6%
vs crush, +3% vs cut and stab, +2% vs heat and poison, and +1% vs cold and 
shock, for each rank you have in Tainted Flesh.  You also gain +1 auto-absorb 
vs physical and half that vs other damage types for each rank in Tainted Flesh,
and gain the Tainted Flesh immunity bonus if the location is unarmoured.

Using this warp on your arms will replace your hands with pincers, providing 
you with an alternative unarmed combat table.

Using this warp on your legs will transform your lower body into that of a 
giant crab, providing you with an alternative feet combat table.
