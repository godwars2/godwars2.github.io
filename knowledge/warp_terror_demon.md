The terror demon is a deadly creature formed from the essence of nightmares, 
constantly warping and adapting to its opponent's weaknesses.

Using this warp on your head enhances your Living Nightmare power, allowing you
to add your rank in Demon Form when determining whether the fear succeeds.

Using this warp on your skin increases both the physical and energy armour of 
your Protean Nemesis power by 1% per rank.

Using this warp on your arms causes them to transform into clubs, spikes or 
blades.  You may alternate freely between the three combat tables, although 
each is only capable of inflicting a single damage type.  If you have the Demon
Spawn talent, then each rank in Protean Nemesis will give your arms a 5% chance
of inflicting an elemental burst on a critical hit.  The type of burst will be 
based on the energy mode of your Protean Nemesis power.

Using this warp on your Inferno makes it inflict Protean Nemesis energy damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
wrists or ankles, this scar increases the bypass of your Protean Nemesis by +2 
physical or +1 energy per rank respectively.  Placed on your chest or stomach,
this scar increases the armour of your Protean Nemesis by +4% physical and +2% 
energy per rank respectively.  Placed on your head, this scar gives the same 
benefits as described for the head warp, except based on your Ritual Scarring.
