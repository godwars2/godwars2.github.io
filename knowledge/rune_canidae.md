The Canidae rune represents the wolf aspect of your bestial nature.

When placed on your cheeks in Wolf Form, this rune allows you to hamstring your
opponent on a critical hit with your bite attack.  Each hamstrung leg reduces 
your opponent's movement rate by 5, although not when they're flying.

When placed on your chest, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour and
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs cut, stab and crush damage, per rank.

When placed on your hands, this rune enhances your Claws of the Wolf, giving 
them an additional +2 Damage and bypass for each rank you have in Blood Runes.

When placed on your feet, this rune provides +1 to running speed per rank.

If you are using Bat Form and have this rune on one or more locations, you get 
the armour bonuses of Lupine Fortitude, and +1 bypass per rank in Claws of the 
Wolf.  Neither of these two bonuses can exceed your rank in Blood Runes.
