The Rat Fiend is a vicious and cunning beast, and carries many foul diseases.

Using this warp on your mouth causes your bite to inflict diseased attacks.

Using this warp on your arms causes your claws to inflict diseased attacks.

Using this warp on your wings replaces your short-range flight and wingbash 
with the ability to infect your weapons with a disease for 1 second per rank.

On a critical hit with a diseased attack you will automatically perform an 
indirect red attack spell.  If successful, your opponent will suffer 1 point 
of damage per second for each rank you have in Tainted Flesh, lasting a number
of seconds equal to your base Tenacity.  If they are already infected, then the
duration is extended (up to a maximum of twice your base Tenacity).
