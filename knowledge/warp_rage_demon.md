The Rage Demon is a fearsome beast of focused anger and unadulterated hatred.

Using this warp on your skin gives +1 per rank to resisting fear while raging.

Using this warp on your arms gives your hands +1 cut, stab and/or crush bypass 
per rank while raging, if you have Cleave, Pierce or Smash respectively.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring, as follows:

When placed on your forehead, this scar turns your pain into aggression.  While
raging, you gain a percentage bonus to Attack and Defence based on how badly
hurt you are: +2% per rank when below 25% health, +1% per rank when below 50%
health, and +1% per two ranks when below 75% health.

When placed on your chest, this scar allows you to better withstand both damage
and fear.  While using Demonic Rage, you gain +1% health per rank, and +1 bonus
per rank for resisting fear spells and effects.

When placed on your stomach, this scar improves your natural ability to resist 
damage.  While using Demonic Rage, each rank in Ritual Scarring gives you +2% 
physical armour to all locations.  You also get +2% heat, cold, shock or mental
armour per rank if you have the Burn, Freeze, Shock or Psionics talents.

When placed on your wrists, this scar improves your natural ability to bypass 
armour.  While using Demonic Rage, each rank in Ritual Scarring gives you +2 
bypass to the appropriate damage type if you have Cleave, Pierce, Smash, Burn, 
Freeze or Shock.  If you have the Great version, the bonus becomes +3 per rank.

When placed on your ankles, this scar allows you to move more quickly and with 
greater agility.  While using Demonic Rage, you gain +1 movement rate per rank,
-1 AP cost per rank for all feet moves, and a flat -1 cooldown to feet defence.
