The bone devil looks like a huge demonic skeleton.

Using this warp on your head changes your horns to antlers, which results in 
your headbutt attacks inflicting stab damage instead of crush damage.

Using this warp on your skin will provide you with +1% natural internal armour 
for each rank you have in each of Demon Form and Tainted Flesh.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1% cut bypass per rank to all attacks 
made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your wings changes their shape, so that your wing attacks 
will stab with the wing tips rather than battering for crush damage.

Using this warp on your Inferno will make it inflict stab damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
chest or stomach, this scar gives +5% natural internal armour per rank.
