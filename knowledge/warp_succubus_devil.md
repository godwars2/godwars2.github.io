The succubi are alluring female demons of unearthly beauty who seduce and kill 
men, then morph into their male (incubi) form to impregnate mortal women.

Using this warp on your mouth replaces your bite with a mental damage kiss.  On
a critical hit your opponent becomes 'tempted' (treated as a wound), making the
Lust option of Road of Seven Sins last twice as long when used on them.

Using this warp on your skin will cause the Lust option of Road of Seven Sins 
to give your victim -2 cut/stab/crush/heat/cold/shock hands bypass per rank, if
you have Cleave, Pierce, Smash, Burn, Freeze and/or Shock respectively.  If you
have the Great version of these talents, your victim suffers an additional -3.

Using this warp on your arms will cause the Lust option of Road of Seven Sins 
to give your victim -2 Attack, Defence and Damage per rank.

Using this warp on your legs will cause the Lust option of Road of Seven Sins 
to give your victim -2% balance and -1 movement rate per rank.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, this replaces your bite with a kiss much like the head warp.
