The bull shark is an aggressive species of shark with a unique tolerance for 
fresh water.  It is usually quite sluggish, but is capable of bursts of speed.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo gives +1 bite and headbutt bypass per
rank.  You also gain an additional +1 bite (NOT headbutt) bypass per rank in 
Greater Shark Spirit, although this cannot exceed your rank in Lunar Tattoos.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo provides you with +2% natural armour and
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs mental damage per rank.  If you also have 
Psionics, your first 10 ranks in this power will each give +1% mental immunity.

When placed on a forearm, this tattoo gives that hand +1 crush bypass per rank 
(both with and without weapons).  You also gain an additional +1 per rank in 
Greater Shark Spirit, although this cannot exceed your rank in Lunar Tattoos.

When placed on your shins, this tattoo allows you to ignore water currents and
increases your swimming movement rate by +1 per rank.
