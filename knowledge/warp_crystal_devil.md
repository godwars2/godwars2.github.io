Crystal devils grow in large caverns below the rocky plains of hell.

Using this warp on your eyes causes your Demonic Rage power to grant bonuses to
Ascendancy, Protection and Power instead of Attack, Defence and Damage.  If you
also have the Devil Spawn talent, the bypass bonuses will apply to Burn, Freeze
and Shock (all based on your naked Aura) instead of Cleave, Pierce and Smash.

Using this warp on your head will replace your Inferno power with a new ability
called Crystal Vortex.  This is activated like a headbutt, but operates like 
the Shadow Infusion power, except that it only stops energy damage.

Using this warp on your skin will make it very hard but rather brittle when 
exposed to the air.  Every unarmoured part of your body (except feet) gains a 
natural armour of +1% vs all damage types for each rank you have in Demon Form,
and +5% vs cut and stab, +2% vs crush, shock and poison, and +1% vs heat and 
cold, for each rank you have in Tainted Flesh.  You also gain +1 auto-absorb
vs physical and half that vs other damage types for each rank in Tainted Flesh,
and gain the Tainted Flesh immunity bonus if the location is unarmoured.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1 bypass per rank for all heat, cold 
and shock damage spells you cast with your bare hands.

Using this warp on your legs causes Evasion to work differently for you: The 
cut, stab and crush immunity will be replaced with heat, cold and shock.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, this scar gives the same benefits as the eyes warp, as well as giving
your magical rage an additional +5 Ascendancy and Protection per rank.
