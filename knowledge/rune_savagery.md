The Savagery rune allows you to better harness the might of your inner beast.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune turns your pain into aggression.  While 
raging, you gain a percentage bonus to Attack and Defence based on how badly 
hurt you are: +2% per rank when below 25% health, +1% per rank when below 50% 
health, and +1% per two ranks when below 75% health.

When placed on your chest, this rune allows you to better withstand both damage
and fear.  While using Rage of the Beast, you gain +1% health per rank, and +1 
bonus per rank for resisting fear spells and effects.

When placed on your hands, this rune improves your natural ability to cut, stab
and crush through armour.  While using Rage of the Beast, each rank in Blood 
Runes gives you +2 cut bypass if you have Cleave, +2 stab bypass if you have 
Pierce and +2 crush bypass if you have Smash.  If you have Great Cleave, Great 
Pierce, or Great Smash, then the bypass bonus is increased to +3 per rank.

When placed on your feet, this rune allows you to move more quickly.  While 
using Rage of the Beast, you gain +1 movement rate per rank.
