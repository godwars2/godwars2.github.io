The pit devils are powerful leviathans who roam the lava oceans of hell.

Using this warp on your head will replace your headbutt with a tentacle attack 
which inflicts stab damage, and an internal crush burst on critical hits.  You 
will feed through your tentacles, recovering health much like a bite attack.

Using this warp on your mouth replaces your bite with a mental blast.  Psionics
and Psychic Mastery upgrade the power of your mental blast, while Soul Devourer
causes you to suck mana from your victims on a critical hit.

Using this warp on your skin will increase your Size by 1 for every 5 ranks you
have in Demon Form, although you will lose the ranked Damage and Power bonuses.

Using this warp on your arms will replace them with long tentacles, giving your
arms +1 foot reach per rank, and providing an unarmed combat table which uses 
the Flails skill and benefits from Whip Mastery and Expert Whip Fighting.

Using this warp on your legs will transform your lower body into a writhing 
mass of tentacles, providing you with alternative feet techniques.

Using this warp on your wings replaces them with four powerful tentacles, which
inflict an internal crush burst on a critical hit, but can't wear wing-spikes.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
chest or stomach, this scar gives +3% natural mental armour per rank.
