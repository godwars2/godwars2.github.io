The Aegis rune represents your resilience and fortitude.  Its soak bonuses only
apply to locations not protected against that damage type by clothes or armour.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune gives +1% immunity and +1 auto-absorb per
rank vs physical, mental and poison damage (also vs heat if you have an Ember 
rune and shock if you have a Thunder rune).  Wolf Form instead protects vs heat
damage, Bat Form vs shock damage, and Mist Form vs physical, cold and poison 
damage.  The immunity given by this power caps at 20%, at rank 20.

When placed on your chest, this rune gives you +5% physical, mental and poison 
armour per rank (also vs heat if you have an Ember rune and shock if you have 
a Thunder rune).  Wolf Form instead gives you +2% physical and heat armour per 
rank.  Bat Form gives +5% shock armour per rank.  Mist Form gives +5% physical,
cold and poison armour per rank.

When placed on your hands, this rune provides both hands +2 Defence per rank, 
added before percentage modifiers.  In Wolf Form and Bat Form, this bonus is 
instead added to your feet, as long as you can already defend with your feet.

When placed on your feet, this rune provides +2 feet Defence per rank, added 
before percentage modifiers.  In Bat Form, you instead gain access to a special
feet defence command, regardless of how many ranks you have in Blood Runes.
