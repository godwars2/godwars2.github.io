This wisdom increases your control over bronze, one of the favoured materials 
of dragonkind.

As a dragon, this wisdom increases your Treasure Hoard poison bypass by +1, but
only if it normally gives at least +2 bypass.  As a human, it allows you to use
Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting on bronze items.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom, with each 
counting as two bronze items for the purposes of Chameleonic Gift.  Used on 
your pattern, it counts as one bronze item.  Used on your mouth or horns, it 
gives them dual poison damage.  Used on your stomach, it gives you acid breath.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on either forearm with this wisdom, giving both
arms +1 poison bypass per rank while raging, or +2 per rank if you have Venom. 
If placed on both forearms, the bypass applies to all locations.  When used on 
your forehead, you gain +1 Defence and Protection per rank for each piece of 
heavy bronze armour you're wearing.
