The Sanguine rune represents the vampiric blood from which you draw your power.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune enhances your Blood Legacy.  While using 
Puissance, you gain +1 physical bypass per rank.  While using Swiftness, you 
gain +1 Speed and movement per rank.  While using Fortitude, you gain +2% spell
armour per rank.  Your bites (including bursts and Bat Form attacks) also gain 
+1 bypass per rank.  Your lowest rank of Blood Runes and Blood Legacy is used.

When placed on your chest, this rune draws upon the power of any bloodsteel you
are wearing in order to strengthen and protect your internals.  While affected 
by Blood Taint, you gain +2% natural internal armour vs all damage types for 
each rank in each of Blood Runes, Blood Forging and Blood Legacy.

When placed on your hands and wearing blood tainted items, this rune allows you
to channel energy from your other runes.  If you have an Ember rune, your hands
will gain fire burst as if they had the Ember hands rune, while Thunder gives 
shock and Umbrage cold.  If you have two such runes, the secondary caps at rank
10.  If you have all three, the secondary caps at rank 14 and the tertiary caps
at rank 7.  The priority for capping purposes is: Umbrage, Thunder, Ember.

When placed on your feet, this rune causes your blood to rapidly adapt your 
body in response to damage.  You receive +2% armour vs one physical damage type
and +1% armour vs one energy damage type, per rank, although this cannot exceed
your rank in Blood Forging.  These two damage types will change every time you 
receive physical or energy damage of a different type.
