This wisdom increases your control over copper, one of the favoured materials 
of dragonkind.

As a dragon, this wisdom increases your Treasure Hoard shock bypass by +1, but
only if it normally gives at least +2 bypass.  As a human, it allows you to use
Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting on copper items.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom, with each 
counting as two copper items for the purposes of Chameleonic Gift.  Used on 
your pattern, it counts as one copper item.  Used on your mouth or horns, it 
gives them dual shock damage.  Used on your stomach, it gives lightning breath.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on either forearm with this wisdom, giving both
arms +1 shock bypass per rank while raging, or +2 per rank if you have Shock. 
If placed on both forearms, the bypass applies to all locations.  When used 
on your forehead, you gain +0.5 Speed per rank for each piece of heavy copper 
armour you're wearing.
