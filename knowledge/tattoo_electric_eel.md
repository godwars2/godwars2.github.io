The electric eel is a species of fish capable of generating powerful electric 
shocks, both for self-defence and to aid in hunting.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo gives you a 5% chance per rank of 
lightning arcing from your fangs whenever your bite attack achieves a critical
success, as well as +1 shock bypass per rank for your bite attack.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo provides you with +4% natural armour and
+2 auto-absorb on all locations vs shock damage per rank.

When placed on a forearm, this tattoo gives you +1 shock bypass per rank to 
all attacks made with that hand (both with and without weapons).

When placed on your shins, this tattoo reduces the AP cost for charging your 
talons by 1 per rank in Lunar Tattoos or Storm Talons, whichever is lowest.
