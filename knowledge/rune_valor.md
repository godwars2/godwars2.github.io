The Valor rune represents your courage and perseverance.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune provides you with a +1 bonus per rank for
the purposes of resisting fear spells and powers.

When placed on your chest, this rune gives +2% armour and +1 auto-absorb to all
locations vs mental damage per rank, and +1 Resistance per rank.  If you have 
the 'honourable' trait, these bonuses are all doubled.

When placed on your hands, this rune improves your falcon (if you also have the
Chivalry talent), adding +2 Attack and +2 Damage per rank to its combat table.

When placed on your feet, this rune improves the kick attack of your warhorse 
(if you also have the Chivalry talent), adding +2 Attack and +2 Damage per rank
to its kick attack technique in combat table.  In addition, your movement speed
increases by +1 per rank when mounted (even without Chivalry).
