The storm demon draws both its name and its power from the infernal storms that
light up the skies of hell.

Using this warp on your head gives a 5% chance per rank of lightning gathering 
on your horns whenever your headbutt attack achieves a critical success.

Using this warp on your mouth gives a 5% chance per rank of lightning arcing 
from your fangs whenever your bite attack achieves a critical success.

Using this warp on your skin changes the immunity, armour, auto-absorb, bypass 
and breath attack from Pathway to Hell from heat damage to shock damage.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1% shock bypass per rank to all attacks
made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your wings will make your wingbash inflict shock damage.

Using this warp on your tail when you have the Bladed Tail power will replace 
the critical hit fire burst with a shock burst.

Using this warp on your Inferno will make it inflict shock damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred location +1 shock bypass 
per rank, or +2 per rank if you have Shock.  Placed on your chest or stomach,
this scar gives +4% natural shock armour per rank.
