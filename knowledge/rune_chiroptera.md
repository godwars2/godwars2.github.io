The Chiroptera rune represents the bat aspect of your bestial nature.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune increases the range of your echolocation 
(see 'help Ears of the Bat') by 25 feet for each rank you have in Blood Runes.

When placed on your chest in human form or Mist Form you gain a pair of batlike
wings.  In Bat Form you instead gain +2 Resistance per rank.  In Wolf Form, if 
you have at least 20 ranks in Blood Runes, you grow into a giant bat instead of
a wolf.  The giant bat form has all the normal benefits of Wolf Form, combined 
with the superior movement of Bat Form, gains +1 Size for every 5 total ranks 
you have in Bat Form and Blood Runes, and is able to wear wing spikes.

When placed on your hands and using human or Mist Form, this rune causes a 
cloud of bats to gather above your head, and unlocks a special unarmed hand 
technique which allows you to direct the bats to attack your enemies.  In Bat 
Form, when merged with your bats from Summon Vermin, your rank in Blood Runes 
is added to your Bat Focus.  Wolf Form gains no benefit from this hands rune.

When placed on your feet, this rune increases the range of your pounces and 
swoops by 100 feet for every 10 ranks.  You still move at 100 feet per second.
