The Imperial Mammoth is the largest of all mammoths, standing at least 14 feet 
at the shoulder and weighing over 10 tonnes.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo gives you a 5% chance per rank of 
flames spraying from your fangs whenever your bite attack achieves a critical
success, as well as +1 heat bypass per rank for your bite attack.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo provides you with +3% natural armour and
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs heat damage, per rank.  If you have Desert 
Wolfkin, your first 10 ranks in this power will each give +1% heat immunity.

When placed on a forearm, this tattoo gives you +1 heat bypass per rank for all
attacks made with that hand (both with and without weapons), and replaces the 
shock burst of Storm Talons with a heat burst (but just for that hand).

When placed on your shins, this tattoo gives you +1 damage and +2 bypass per 
rank to all feet attacks, including kick, stamp and pounce.
