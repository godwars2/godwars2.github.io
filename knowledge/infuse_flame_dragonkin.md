This wisdom represents one of the four main paths of dragonkind, all of which 
must be learned before the young hatchling can become a full dragon.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom to give +4%
heat armour per rank, or your pattern to give +2% heat armour per rank.  When 
used on your mouth or horns, it'll give a 5% chance per rank of causing a fire 
burst on a critical hit.  Used on your stomach, it'll enhance your fire breath,
while your talons gain +1 heat bypass per rank in Chameleonic Gift if you also 
have Great Burn.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on your forearms with this wisdom, giving them 
+1 heat bypass per rank, or +2 per rank if you also have Burn.  When used on 
your forehead, you gain +1% heat immunity per rank, up to a maximum of 20% at 
rank 20.  Used on your chest or stomach, you gain +3% heat armour per rank.
