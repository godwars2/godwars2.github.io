The frost demon may initially appear to be a paradox - a creature of frost who 
lives in the heat of hell.  The truth, however, is that the frost demon creates
cold by drawing the heat out of everything nearby.

Using this warp on your head gives you a 5% chance per rank of frost gathering 
on your horns whenever your headbutt attack achieves a critical success.

Using this warp on your mouth gives a 5% chance per rank of frost spraying from
your mouth whenever your bite attack achieves a critical success.

Using this warp on your skin changes the immunity, armour, auto-absorb, bypass 
and breath attack from Pathway to Hell from heat damage to cold damage.

Using this warp on your arms provides 1% cold bypass per rank to all attacks 
made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your wings will make your wingbash inflict cold damage.

Using this warp on your tail when you have the Bladed Tail power will replace 
the critical hit fire burst with a frost burst.

Using this warp on your Inferno will make it inflict cold damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred location +1 cold bypass 
per rank, or +2 per rank if you have Freeze.  Placed on your chest or stomach,
this scar gives +4% natural cold armour per rank.
