The rock devil is strong, tough, and stupid, making it the perfect foot soldier
for hell's army.

Using this warp on your head will provide you with +1% crush bypass to all 
attacks made with your head.

Using this warp on your skin will make it extremely tough, but only when your 
skin is exposed to the air.  Every unarmoured part of your body (except feet) 
gains a natural armour of +1% vs all damage types for each rank you have in 
Demon Form, and +4% vs physical, +2% vs heat and poison, and +1% vs cold and 
shock, for each rank you have in Tainted Flesh.  You also gain +1 auto-absorb 
vs physical and half that vs other damage types for each rank in Tainted Flesh,
and gain the Tainted Flesh immunity bonus if the location is unarmoured.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1% crush bypass per rank to all attacks
made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your Inferno will make it inflict crush damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred location +1 crush bypass 
per rank, or +2 per rank if you have Smash.  Placed on your chest or stomach,
this scar gives +5% natural crush armour per rank.
