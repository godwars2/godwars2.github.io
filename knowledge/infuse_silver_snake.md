This wisdom increases your control over silver, one of the favoured materials 
of dragonkind.

As a dragon, this wisdom increases your Treasure Hoard cold bypass by +1, but 
only if it normally gives at least +2 bypass.  As a human, it allows you to use
Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting on silver items.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom, with each 
counting as two silver items for the purposes of Chameleonic Gift.  Used on 
your pattern, it counts as one silver item.  Used on your mouth or horns, it 
gives them dual cold damage.  Used on your stomach, it gives you frost breath.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on either forearm with this wisdom, giving both
arms +1 cold bypass per rank while raging, or +2 per rank if you have Freeze.  
If placed on both forearms, the bypass applies to all locations.  When used 
on your forehead, you gain +1 Attack and Ascendancy per rank for each piece of 
heavy silver armour you're wearing.
