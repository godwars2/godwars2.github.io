The gray fox is a small and agile forest dweller, able to climb trees.  It is 
considered to be among the most primitive of the canine family.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo causes your eyes to gleam, enhancing 
your natural ability to detect invisible creatures by +1 per rank, although 
this bonus cannot exceed your rank in Feral Senses.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo gives you +4 Attack per rank, added 
before all percentage modifiers.  If you also have Foxkin Family, your first 10
ranks in this power will each give +1% mental immunity.

When placed on your forearms, this tattoo reduces the AP cost of hand attacks 
by 1 for each rank in Lunar Tattoos or Greater Fox Spirit, whichever is lowest.

When placed on your shins, this tattoo increases your ability to dodge during 
cooldown by +1% feet Defence per rank, although this cannot exceed your rank in
Greater Fox Spirit.  This stacks with the natural 33% from wolfman or Wolf Form
or the 50% from Instinctive Dodge, but not with Enhanced Deflection.
