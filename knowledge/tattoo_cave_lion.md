The cave lion is probably the largest cat that ever lived - it is even larger 
than the sabre-toothed tiger.  It has faint tiger-like stripes, a tufted tail 
and a slight ruff of fur around its neck.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo increases the effectiveness of your 
Thundering Roar power.  Your rank in Lunar Tattoos will be added to that of 
Thundering Roar for the purposes of checking whether the Fear works.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo gives you +1 Resistance per rank, added
before all percentage modifiers.  It also gives you a +1 bonus per rank for 
resisting fear spells and effects while in a rage (such as Spirit of Fenris).

When placed on your forearms, this tattoo provides +2 Attack and Damage per 
rank for all unarmed attacks you make with that arm.

When placed on your shins, this tattoo allows you to automatically recover from
sweeps and knockdowns, regardless of your rank in Lunar Tattoos.
