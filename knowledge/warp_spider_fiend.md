The spider fiend is a fearsome and relentless hunter.

Using this warp on your head gives you a pair of feelers, which replaces your 
headbutt attack with the ability to taste the air for nearby victims.

Using this warp on your skin will provide you with +1% natural crush armour per
rank to all locations.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1% poison bypass per rank to all 
attacks made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your legs will transform your lower body into that of a 
spider, giving you the ability to entrap your enemies with sticky webbing.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred location +1 poison bypass
per rank, or +2 per rank if you have Fiend Spawn.
