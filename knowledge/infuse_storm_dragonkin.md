This wisdom represents one of the four main paths of dragonkind, all of which 
must be learned before the young hatchling can become a full dragon.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom to give +4%
shock armour per rank, or your pattern to give +2% shock armour per rank.  When
used on your mouth or horns, it'll give a 5% chance per rank of causing a shock
burst on a critical hit.  Used on the stomach, it'll give you lightning breath,
while your talons gain +1 shock bypass per rank in Chameleonic Gift if you also
have Great Shock.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on your forearms with this wisdom, giving them 
+1 shock bypass per rank, or +2 per rank if you also have Shock.  When used on 
your forehead, you gain +1% shock immunity per rank, up to a maximum of 20% at 
rank 20.  Used on your chest or stomach, you gain +3% shock armour per rank.
