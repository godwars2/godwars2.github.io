The king cobra is the longest of the venomous land snakes, capable of staring a
human in the eye when standing upright.  Its bite injects a powerful venom in 
sufficient quantities to kill a full-grown elephant.

When placed on your forehead, this tattoo gives you a 5% chance per rank of 
injecting your victim with venom whenever your bite attack achieves a critical
success, as well as +1 poison bypass per rank for your bite attack.

When placed on your chest, this tattoo provides you with +2% natural armour on
all locations vs poison damage per rank.  If you also have Swamp Wolfkin, your 
first 10 ranks in this power will each give +1% poison immunity.

When placed on a forearm, this tattoo gives you +1 poison bypass per rank to 
all attacks made with that hand (both with and without weapons).

When placed on your shins, this tattoo allows you to bite while prone.
