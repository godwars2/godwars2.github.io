This wisdom increases your control over brass, one of the favoured materials 
of dragonkind.

As a dragon, this wisdom increases your Treasure Hoard physical bypass by +1, 
but only if it normally gives at least +2 bypass.  As a human, it allows you to
use Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting on brass items.

As a draconian, you can infuse your scales or hide with this Wisdom, with each 
counting as two brass items for the purposes of Chameleonic Gift.  Used on your
pattern, it counts as one brass item.  Used on your mouth or horns, it gives 
them dual cut damage.  Used on your stomach, it improves your bite attack.

As a human, you can draw glyphs on either forearm with this wisdom, giving both
arms +1 cut/stab/crush bypass per rank while raging, or +2 per rank if you have
Cleave/Pierce/Smash.  If you place this glyph on both forearms you gain no 
extra benefit.  When used on your forehead, you gain +2 Health and Mana per 
rank for each piece of heavy brass armour you're wearing.
