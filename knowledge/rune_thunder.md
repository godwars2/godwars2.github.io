The Thunder rune represents your inner struggle against the forces of nature.

When placed on your cheeks, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour vs
shock damage per rank.  In addition, if you use the Cloak of Shadows power, the
armour bonus it provides will also apply against shock damage.

When placed on your chest, this rune provides you with +2% natural armour and 
+1 auto-absorb on all locations vs shock damage per rank.

When placed on your hands, this rune allows you to channel lightning through 
your weapons, claws and fists.  Each time you inflict a critical hit with such 
an attack, there is a 5% chance per rank of lightning arcing from your weapon, 
claws or fists.  You also receive +1 bypass per rank for the lightning burst.

When placed on your feet, this rune improves your ability to resist lightning.
You gain +1% immunity to shock damage for each rank you have in Path of Shadows
or Blood Runes, whichever is lower, up to a maximum of 20% immunity at rank 20.
