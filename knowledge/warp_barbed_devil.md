What the barbed devil lacks in intelligence, it more than makes up for in pure 
aggression.

Using this warp on your head or mouth will make your fangs or horns serrated, 
changing your bite or headbutt from crush damage to cut damage.

Using this warp on your skin will provide you with +1% natural cut armour per
rank to all locations.

Using this warp on your arms provides +1% cut bypass per rank to all attacks 
made with your left or right hand (both with and without weapons).

Using this warp on your wings changes their shape, so that your wing attacks 
will cut with the wing tips rather than battering for crush damage.

Using this warp on your Inferno will make it inflict cut damage.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, wrists or ankles, this provides the scarred location +1 cut bypass 
per rank, or +2 per rank if you have Cleave.  Placed on your chest or stomach, 
this scar gives +5% natural cut armour per rank.
