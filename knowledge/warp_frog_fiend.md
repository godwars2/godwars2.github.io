Using this warp on your mouth gives you a long sticky tongue, replacing your 
bite attack.  On a regular hit you'll have an equal chance of striking your 
opponent's neck, left arm, right arm or both arms, adding a tech delay of 1 
second per 10 ranks.  On a critical hit, you'll perform a knockdown.

Using this warp on your skin will make your flesh spongy like that of a frog, 
giving you +1 auto-absorb per rank to all locations vs crush damage.

Using this warp on your arms will make your hands large and webbed, giving you
+1 movement rate per rank when swimming.

Using this warp on your legs will make your feet large and webbed, providing 
you with an alternative feet table.

Using this warp on your wings will replace your wingbash with the ability to 
envenom your weapons, causing them to perform a poison burst on a critical hit 
from cut and stab attacks.  The venom on each hand lasts 5 seconds, +1 second 
per 5 ranks, or until successfully used.  You also lose short-range flight.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
forehead, you will gain the Frog Fiend's tongue instead of your bite attack.
