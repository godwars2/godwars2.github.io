The slug fiend is a dangerous predator which lives in the lava rivers of hell.

Using this warp on your skin will cause Tainted Flesh to give +3 natural poison
armour per rank instead of +1, although it will no longer give shock armour.

Using this warp on your arms will replace your regular unarmed attack with an 
acidic slime touch which inflicts dual heat/poison damage.

Using this warp on your legs will transform your lower body into that of a huge
slug, providing you with an alternative feet combat table.

Using this warp on your wings will make your wingbash inflict heat/poison dual
damage burst on a critical hit.  However you also lose short-range flight.
