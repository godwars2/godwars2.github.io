The dust devil sweeps back and forth across the plains of hell, hunting prey.

Using this warp on your head will replace your Inferno power with a new ability
called Dust Vortex.  This is activated like a headbutt, but operates like the 
Shadow Infusion power, except that it only stops physical and poison damage.

Using this warp on your skin replace the ranked Damage, Power and Resistance 
bonuses from Demon Form with +6 Defence and Protection per rank.

Using this warp on your arms will leave you without arms.  Your left and right 
combat tables will provide additional dodge defences which get an extra +50 
Defence every 10 ranks.  Your head, feet and tail attacks also get +2 energy 
and +1 non-energy bypass per rank in each of Demon Form and Tainted Talons.

Using this warp on your legs replaces them with a swirling vortex of dust - you
ignore terrain penalties and constantly hover above the ground.  If you also 
have the Dust Devil skin, arms or wings warp, you fly at jogging speed instead 
of walking speed.  If you have two or all three, you fly at running speed.

Using this warp on your wings will make your wingbash knock your opponent over 
whenever you inflict a critical hit.

In human form you may use this knowledge for Ritual Scarring.  Placed on your 
ankles, this scar increases your movement speed by +1 per rank.
