### Build Basics

Scaled powers (see 'help scaling'), gains bonuses from valuable metals,
fairly customisable, can choose to focus on either heat, cold, shock, poison or
mental (both as offence and defence).  Forms: human, draconian and dragon.

If you don't know where to start, consider getting one of the following:

1. Draconic Rage, Extended Rage, Berserker Rage and a Dragon Descendant.
2. Winds of the Mind, Serenity, Martial Gnosis and a Style Mastery.

Then focus on one of the following power/talent combinations:

1. Human Form, Dragon Mount, Dragonbone Forging and Dragonscale Crafting.
2. Draconian Form, Salamanders Gift and Chameleonic Gift.
3. Dragon Form, any 1 Lord power, and either Treasure Hoard or Dragon Barding.

If you go the Dragon Form route, you'll almost always want Natural Fortitude.

You should also train up the damage-oriented power that corresponds to your
Dragon Descendant talent (eg Fires of the Volcano and Red Dragon Descendant).
