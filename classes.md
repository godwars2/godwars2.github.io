A newly created Supernaturalis is often referred to as an 'unimbued' - an empty
avatar which hasn't yet found its calling.

To become imbued you need to have at least five talents, wear a black sash
that you've earned from the dojo, and be holding two classing tokens for the
class you wish to join.  Type 'class \<class name>' to join a class - but once
you've chosen you can never go back, so think carefully before deciding.  Upon
becoming imbued you will gain 50 bonus stat points, distributed according to
your class.  You will also gain access to a range of class powers, and be able
to train your stats.  Each time you train a stat, the mud will also boost
another stat, randomly selected based on your class.

Each class belongs to one of four callings: Revenant are those who draw their
power from a state of undeath, Lycanthropes gain power through animal spirits,
Illuminati study ancient lore and master their inner potential, and Nephilim
gain power by possessing or merging with non-human entities.
