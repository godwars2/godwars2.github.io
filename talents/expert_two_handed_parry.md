This talent improves your ability to parry when wielding a greatsword, bastard
sword, katana, falchion or non-ethereal darkblade two-handed.  All two-handed
techniques (which are normally coloured cyan when wielding the weapon in two
hands) providing a parry defence will have their Defence bonuses increased by
+10, and gain the ability to parry paired weapon attacks.  In addition, your
defence cooldown will be reduced by 2 when wielding one of the aforementioned
weapons two-handed.  This talent also allows you to perform a counterattack
against double attacks.
