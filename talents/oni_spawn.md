You are one of the Oni, a faction of gigantic hideous demons who fled from hell many thousands of years ago and came to settle in the far east, where they take great pleasure in deceiving and devouring the local human population.

The Oni have become adept at concealing themselves among humans. If you turn invisible, your rank in Demon Form will be added to your invisibility rank.

You can craft and wear animal hide loincloths, which provide every unarmoured part of your body with +1% armour vs all damage types per rank in Demon Form, as well as +4% physical, +2% heat and +1% cold/shock/poison armour per rank in Tainted Flesh. You also gain +1 auto-absorb vs physical and half that vs other damage types per rank in Tainted Flesh, and gain the Tainted Flesh immunity if the location is unarmoured. The loincloth counts as unarmoured for this bonus, but the bonus doesn't stack with unarmoured skin warps (such as Rock Devil).

Most Oni favour huge warclubs called tetsubo, which they can 'conjure' at will, and this talent also serves as the tetsubo Weapon Mastery. Your Tainted Talons bonuses will also be applied to the tetsubo when it is conjured, and this same power will grant additional benefits based on your eyes warp. If you also have Inferno, then that will also provide extra benefits to your tetsubo.
