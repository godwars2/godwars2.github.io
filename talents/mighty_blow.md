You have adopted a specialised style of fighting which allows you to perform
mighty attacks by adding a '+' after the two-letter command - for example to
execute a mighty right-handed slash, type 'rs+'.  A mighty attack suffers a +1
second delay penalty, and the resulting technique has its Damage doubled.

If your attack has a burst, Mighty Blow will also apply to the burst.  Paused
attacks (such as jousting with a lance) are not affected by this talent.
