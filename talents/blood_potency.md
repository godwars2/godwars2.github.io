You have learned to concentrate the potency of the vampiric blood that runs
through your veins, allowing you to draw upon its full potential.  When you
activate Blood Legacy, you can type 'legacy full' to gain the combined bonuses
of Puissance, Swiftness and Fortitude at the same time.  This counts as using
all three bonus types simultaneously for the purposes of any other abilities,
such as the Sanguine Blood Rune.  You cannot activate the combined bonuses
while raging, nor can you activate Rage of the Beast while they are active.
