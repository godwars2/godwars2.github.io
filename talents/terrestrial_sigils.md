This talent indicates that you have mastered the simplest level of dragon
magic, that of the Terrestrial Sigils.  This gives you the ability to draw
sigils with your draconic talons if you couldn't already (i.e., the talons of
a dragon or draconian), and if you are a full dragon this talent also allows
you to grow draconic talons while in human form via the 'talons' command.

You gain access to the spell sigils for forcefield, heal, mend, bless, umbral
chameleon and umbral sight.  If you have the Red, White, Blue or Black Dragon
Descendant talent, then you also unlock the heat wave, cold wave, shock wave
or gas wave spell sigils respectively.
