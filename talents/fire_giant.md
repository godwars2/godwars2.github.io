According to an ancient prophecy, in the Final Battle the fire giants will
charge forth from their brass city, and their leader's blazing sword will add
a blood red colour to the twilight of the entire world.  It is said that the
World Serpent itself will be scorched in the heat of this battle, and that the
survivors will be cast out into the multiverse to become the gods of a new age.

Your innate heat bypass is increased to +1 per rank instead of +1 per 3 ranks,
while your innate heat immunity is doubled (see 'help innate').

If you are an Elder Fire Giant, your innate cut bypass is doubled to +2 per
rank, and you gain +10% immunity vs energy damage.  If you also have Primordial
Breath, it will cause your opponent to burst into flames on a critical hit in
the same way as the Immolate spell, using your rank in Precise Throw.
