This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Clubs skill when using a cudgel or mace. This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill maximum). Note also that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for take half damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their encumbrance reduced by one.
