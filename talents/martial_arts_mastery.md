This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Daggers skill when using butterfly
knives, tiger claws or katars.  This bonus will not show up in your score, but
is instead added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement
difficulty or skill maximum).  Note also that weapons you have the appropriate
Mastery for take half damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and
have their encumbrance reduced by one.
