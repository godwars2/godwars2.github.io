Most members of House BloodStone use arcane alchemical techniques to enhance
the potency of their blood, but a rare few have adopted a more primitive
approach, using their inner beast as a direct conduit to the mystical power
of their blood.  These berserk warriors call themselves the Blood Reavers.

Blood Reavers are renowned for becoming increasingly tougher the more they're
hurt.  While raging, you gain a bonus to Resistance equal to double the pain
penalty you would normally suffer to Attack and Defence (see 'help pain').

When activating Blood Legacy or Rage of the Beast, the duration will be set to
the highest of the two powers (for example if you have rank 3 Blood Legacy and
no ranks in Extended Rage, your Rage of the Beast will last 45 seconds).

While raging and wielding a bloodsteel weapon, you gain +50 critical bypass if
it is throbbing, and +100 critical bypass if it is pulsating.

See 'help critical-bypass' for more details on how critical bypass works.
