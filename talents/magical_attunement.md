This talent represents your natural attunement with enchanted items. You are able to withstand a number of points in each of Enchantment and Unenchantment equal to half your age before you start suffering radiation penalties. These bonuses are created via the mage Enchantment power (see 'help enchantment').

For example, at age 100 you could wear up to 50 points of Enchantment and 50 points of Unenchantment, without suffering any penalties.
