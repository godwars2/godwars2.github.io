This talent provides you with a supernaturally powerful metabolism. You digest food at twice the normal speed, recover twice as much health as normal from doing so, and are able to consume even the most potent of poisons without harm.

In addition, each point of Mettle increases the amount of food you can digest by 10%. Furthermore, each point of Mettle provides you 1 point of auto-absorb against all other types of poison damage. If your Mettle exceeds 10, then only every second point beyond that counts towards the auto-absorb (so a Mettle of 12 would give only 11 auto-absorb against poison damage).
