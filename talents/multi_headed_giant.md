The first giant was Aurgelmir, born from the primeval chaos of the Nexus and later slain by one-eyed Wotan and his brothers. According to legend, a giant son and giantess daughter grew from Aurgelmir's armpits while he slept, and his feet copulated and gave birth to a son with six heads. This six-headed giant was Thrudgelmir, first of the ettin bloodline.

Rock Hard Head grants you +4 Attack, Damage and bypass per rank instead of the usual +2 per rank. Furthermore, if your first headbutt successfully hits, you will automatically follow up 1 second later with a second headbutt attack.

Your innate crush and mental immunity is doubled (see 'help innate').
