You were born under the dark moon, and have always been skilled at controlling and concealing your emotions. As you've grown older and more powerful, your degree of self control has reached epic proportions.

Although you still feel pain, you have trained yourself to mentally block it out. Your pain penalties (see 'help pain') are reduced to 0%, regardless of how much damage you have taken.

If you have Iron Will, you gain a +50% bonus to Health, applied before any other percentage modifiers. If you also have Endurance, the two bonuses are added together, giving you a total combined bonus of +75% Health.

Finally, this talent gives you a bonus of +5 ranks in Self Control.
