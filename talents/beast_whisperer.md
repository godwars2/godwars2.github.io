Many vampires are able to control wolves and vermin, but you possess a natural talent that grants you a special empathic relationship with such beasts.

Your wolves and vermin gain +1 bypass and +1% critical bypass for each rank you have in Summon Wolf and Summon Vermin respectively.

This talent also gives you a bonus of +5 ranks in Beast Master.
