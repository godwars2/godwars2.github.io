This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Swords skill when using a greatsword
or bastard sword.  This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead
added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty
or skill maximum).  Note also that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for
take half damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their
encumbrance reduced by one.
