You are one of the Arctic Wolfkin, a tribe of werewolf descendants who live in
the frozen, windy plains of the tundra.  This provides you with 25% immunity to
cold damage and 1 point of cold auto-absorb for every point you have in Mettle.
If your Mettle exceeds 10, then only every second point beyond that counts (so
a Mettle of 12 would give only 11 auto-absorb against cold damage).

The Arctic Wolfkin are renowned for their resilience.  The Resistance bonus of
your Beasthide is doubled, as is the Defence and Armour bonus from Thick Pelt.

If you also have the Lupine Fortitude power, and are transformed into wolf or
wolfman form, then each rank in Lupine Fortitude will provide you with +4% cold
armour instead of +2%.
