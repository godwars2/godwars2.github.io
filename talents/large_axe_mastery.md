This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Axes skill when using a battleaxe or
greataxe.  This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added
afterwards (meaning it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill
maximum).  Note that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for take half
damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their encumbrance
reduced by one.
