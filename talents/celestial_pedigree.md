You are a purebreed dragon, descended from one of the Celestial bloodlines, who were the first to travel the planes and explore beyond the Dragon Realm. They have spiritually ascended, and are no longer creatures of pure flesh and blood.

You get +1 heat, cold, shock and mental hand bypass per rank in Dragon Form if you have Great Burn, Great Freeze, Great Shock or Psionics respectively. You get +1 mental bypass per rank in Winds of the Mind if you have Psychic Mastery.

In addition, your semi-ethereal state causes all of your physical attacks to become dual mental damage, including your physical breath attack.

As with all purebreed dragons, your scales are stronger than normal. Each rank in Dragon Form gives you +1% armour vs cut, stab and crush damage, +2% armour vs heat, cold and shock, +3% armour vs mental and +4% armour vs poison damage.

Note that these bonuses only apply while you are in Dragon Form.
