If you have Enhanced Deflection, this talent strengthens your forcefield spell to provide an additional +1% spell armour to all locations vs physical damage for each point you have in Aura. If you are also a full mage, your forcefield will give an additional +1% spell armour to all locations vs physical, heat, cold and shock damage for each rank you have in Earth Magic, Fire Magic, Water Magic and Air Magic respectively. The various Adept talents also count as 5 ranks (for example Flameborn Adept will give your forcefield +5% heat armour).

If you have Rigid Feathers, Thick Pelt or Tough Hide, this talent strengthens them to provide an additional +1% spell armour to all locations vs physical damage for each point you have in Mettle. This bonus does not apply if you also have Enhanced Deflection - it will only apply to the forcefield.

This talent also increases your maximum post-bypass soak percentage from 75% to 90% for your spell armour layer (see 'help armour').
