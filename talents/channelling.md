Many spells have the option of being enhanced, although this invariably comes
with a mana cost (see 'help magic').  This talent halves the mana cost for all
enhanced spells, and sometimes provides them with an additional bonus as well.

Note that certain spells and powers may drain your entire remaining mana for a
greatly enhanced effect - in this case, your mana will still be drained, but it
will be treated as if you had twice your actual remaining mana.
