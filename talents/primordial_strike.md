Primordial energy shoots from your fists and forehead whenever they inflict a
critical hit.  If you have Burn, Freeze or Shock, then this burst will cause
heat, cold or shock damage respectively.  If you have two or all three of the
talents, the damage type will be randomly determined each time you hit.  If you
don't have Burn, Freeze or Shock, your burst will instead cause crush damage.

If you are a full titan, burst attacks made with your fists will gain +1 bypass
per rank in Hammer Fists, while burst attacks made with your forehead will gain
+1 bypass per rank in Rock Hard Head.
