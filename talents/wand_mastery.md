This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your magic colours when using wands. This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill maximum). Note also that you will be able to use your other hand freely (allowing paired wands if you wish) and the encumbrance of wands will be reduced by one.
