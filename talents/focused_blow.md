You have adopted a specialised style of fighting which allows you to focus your attacks by adding a '+' after the two-letter command - for example to focus a right-handed slash, type 'rs+'. A focused attack suffers a +1 second delay penalty, and the resulting technique has its Attack and bypass doubled. This bypass bonus only applies to the +20/+10/+5/+0 innate and critical bypass.

If your attack has a burst, Focused Blow will also apply to the burst. Paused attacks (such as jousting with a lance) are not affected by this talent.
