This talent allows your packmates to share your rage in combat. They gain the same rank as you in Rage of the Beast, Spirit of Fenris or Demonic Rage, and also get the same rank as you in Extended Rage. If you have Berserker Rage or Tireless Rage, your packmates will get those talents as well.

Whenever you activate your rage, your canine packmates will also attempt to activate their own.
