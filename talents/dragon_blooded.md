One of your forefathers was a dragon, and some of the heritage of that union
has been passed on to you.  While still far weaker than a true dragon, you are
able to utilise some of their minor abilities.

You can use the 'ht' (head travel) command to fly distances up to 5000 feet.

You can use the 'hd' (head dragonhide) command to turn your skin scaly, giving
you a Resistance bonus based on your Green Magic skill and allowing you to use
a third of your feet defence during cooldown.  This can also be enhanced (by
typing 'hd+'), which makes it permanent and increases the Resistance bonus.

You can breath fire on your opponent by typing 'hc' (head concentrate) followed
by 'hb' (head bite).  This is treated as a ranged magic attack.

You can use the 'fw' (feet wingbash) command as an attack.  If you are in the
air when you perform it, you instead remain airborne for another 3 seconds,
during which time you will move at 100 feet per second.

If you are a true dragon (or have Dragon Hatchling), this talent counts as 5
extra ranks in Dragon Form for the purposes of natural armour and auto-absorb.
