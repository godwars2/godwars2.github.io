This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Polearms skill when using a staff.
This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added afterwards
(meaning it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill maximum).
Note also that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for take half damage
when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their encumbrance reduced
by one.
