You are a multi-headed hydra, one of the rarer dragon breeds.  While in Dragon
Form, your left and right hand locations are replaced with head combat tables,
representing the additional heads on the left and right side of your body.

The basic hydra has only three heads, but every five ranks in Salamanders Gift
adds an extra one (first on the left, then the right, then in the centre).  If
you perform a full breath attack, each head beyond the first on the attacking
location gives +1 Attack, Damage and bypass for each rank in Dragon Form.

You may infuse your left, right and centre head locations with dragon wisdoms,
and these will change the breath weapon for that location, as well as provide a
bypass bonus of +2 per rank in Dragon Form for the appropriate damage type.  A
location without an infusion instead gains +2 bite bypass per rank.

Your three head infusions will also determine the colour of your scales, giving
you armour bonuses in much the same way as the scales and hide infusions do for
Draconian Form, except based on your rank in Dragon Form.  You also get a bonus
for your pattern, as long as you have at least two different head infusions.

Note that these bonuses only apply while you are in Dragon Form.
