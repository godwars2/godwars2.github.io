Through incredible mental discipline, you have learned to completely ignore the side affects of physical pain. Your pain penalties (see 'help pain') are reduced to 0%, regardless of how much damage you have taken. In addition, your discipline provides you with a +25 bonus to Protection (which replaces the bonus granted from Mind Over Matter), added before percentages modifiers, and gives 50% natural mental armour (replacing the 25% from Mind Over Matter).
