You are a member of House ShadowSworn, one of the great vampire orders. This provides you access to a range of hand-based spells, which you can activate by typing 'magic'. As well as providing the standard spells, this talent also gives you the Summon Shadow and Shadowbolt spells.

House ShadowSworn are also the masters of the infamous shadow drakes, which you can summon via the 'hs' (head summon) command.

If you are also a vampire, your Path of Shadows power will unlock additional spells as you gain ranks. In addition, while riding a shadow drake, each rank in Beast Master will grant +1 to the Attack, Defence and Damage of your feet techniques, and increase your drake's flight distance by 1000 feet.
