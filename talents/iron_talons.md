This talent gives your talons the consistency of iron. When using natural claw attacks, you gain +1 Damage for each point of Brawn you have (added as if it were a natural weapon bonus). If your Brawn exceeds 10, then only every second point beyond that counts (so a Brawn of 12 would give your claws +11 damage).

The increased durability of your talons also allows you to block melee attacks as if you were wearing bracers, and grants your hands a natural immunity of 25% on your hands against all types of damage except mental. Finally, this talent gives you +10 bypass with your claw attacks (see 'help bypass').
