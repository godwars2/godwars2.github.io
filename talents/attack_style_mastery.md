This talent gives a +30% Attack bonus when using the Mongoose basic fighting
style, a +25% Attack bonus when using the Bear, Monkey, Swallow or Cobra
advanced fighting styles, a +20% Attack bonus when using the Hawk, Rhino, Lion,
Ape, Asp or Serpent super fighting styles, and a +15% Attack bonus when using
any other fighting style.  These bonuses do not show up in your score, but are
instead added afterwards (meaning they don't count towards your improvement
difficulty or fighting style maximum).  In addition, when using one of the 11
fighting styles listed above, all style-specific combat techniques gain a +10%
bonus to their Attack, Defence and Damage.  Note that this technique bonus is
automatically applied to your combat table, and does not stack with technique
bonuses granted from other Style Mastery talents.
