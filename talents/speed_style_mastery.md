This talent gives you a +30% Speed bonus when using the Viper basic fighting style, a +25% Speed bonus when using the Cobra, Tiger, Mantis or Fox advanced fighting styles, a +20% Speed bonus when using the Lion, Leopard, Serpent, Asp, Wolf or Flea super fighting styles, and a +15% Speed bonus when using any other fighting style. These bonuses will not show up in your score, but are instead added afterwards (meaning they don't count towards your improvement difficulty or fighting style maximum). In addition, when using one of the 11 fighting styles listed above, all style-specific combat techniques gain a +10% bonus to their Attack, Defence and Damage. Note that this technique bonus is automatically applied to your combat table, and does not stack with technique bonuses granted from other Style Mastery talents.
