This talent causes your hide to become covered with long feathers, which become rigid when using Dragonhide. This only applies while in Dragon Form; although most dragons are hairless, a small minority have fur or feathers.

The duration of the Dragonhide is doubled, and the Resistance bonus is replaced with a Defence bonus of four times the normal Resistance bonus. You also get a spell armour bonus of +10% to all locations against physical damage.

In addition, the mana cost for boosting Dragonhide is halved, the casting time is reduced from 2 seconds to 1, and the AP cost reduced from 75 to 50.
