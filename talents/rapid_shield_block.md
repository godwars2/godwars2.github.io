After successfully performing a defensive move, the defending location requires
some time to recover before it can be used again (see 'help cooldown').  This
talent allows you to perform shield blocks even during cooldown, although you
can do so at only a third of your normal Defence rating.  In addition, the cost
for performing shield defence commands is reduced by 25 AP.

Shields are able to soak damage in the same way as armour, but their soak is
normally halved while they are performing techniques or during cooldown.  This
talent prevents the soak from being halved.
