You were born under a blood moon - also known as a lunar eclipse. This rare event occurs during a full moon, but renders the moon almost invisible, and therefore represents the joining of both full and dark moon; the self control of the individual is combined with the unbridled power of the wolf.

This talent gives a bonus of +5 ranks in Wolf Form and Lupine Fortitude. You only receive this bonus for powers in which you have trained at least 1 rank.
