You were born under the waning moon, and exist between the spirit world and
the real world.  As you've grown older and more powerful, you've learned to
draw upon your birthright and the power it represents.

Your fangs and claws inflict dual mental damage.  Talents and powers which add
bypass to your fangs or claws will also add their bonuses to the mental bypass.

Your Storm Talons inflict dual mental damage, and their ranked bypass bonus is
doubled (i.e., +2 per rank, or +4 with Shock/Burn/Freeze).  This also applies
to the mental damage, which gets +2 bypass per rank, or +4 with Psionics.

Finally, this talent gives you a bonus of +5 ranks in Lunar Tattoos.
