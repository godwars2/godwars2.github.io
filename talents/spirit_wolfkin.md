You are one of the Spirit Wolfkin, a tribe of shamanistic werewolf descendants who draw their power from animal spirits. This provides you with access to a range of hand-based spells, which you can activate by typing 'magic'. As well as providing the standard spells, this talent also gives you Spiritshield and Spirit Bolt.

If you are also a werewolf, your Ride the Storm power will unlock additional spells as you gain ranks. You will not be able to cast spells while in wolf form, however, due to your lack of hands.
