You have a knack for turning your body when struck so that the most resilient parts of your armour intercept incoming attacks.

When you are wearing heavy armour, its soak and auto-absorb are doubled.

You are able to wear heavy armour as if it were one encumbrance point lighter, representing the natural ease with which you wear such armour.

This talent also raises your maximum post-bypass soak percentage to 90% for all worn armour (not just heavy armour), although it won't help natural armour.
