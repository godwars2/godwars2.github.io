This talent indicates that you are particularly adept at fighting with two weapons. While fighting with a weapon in each hand, any technique which is coloured cyan gains a +50% bonus to Attack, Defence and Damage (assuming those values are positive to start with). Note that this bonus is applied to the technique itself, and your combat tables (available via 'l?' and 'r?' for left hand and right hand respectively) will be automatically updated to reflect the adjusted values. In addition, any modified technique with a delay of 3 or more seconds will have its delay time reduced by 1.
