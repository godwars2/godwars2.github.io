This talent provides you with a particularly tough hide when using Demonhide or Dragonhide. It applies to all forms.

The duration of your Demonhide or Dragonhide is doubled, and the Resistance bonus it grants is also doubled. It also gains +10% armour to all locations against physical damage, which counts as spell armour (see 'help armour').

In addition, the mana cost is reduced by half, the casting time is reduced from 2 seconds to 1, and the AP cost is reduced from 75 to 50.
