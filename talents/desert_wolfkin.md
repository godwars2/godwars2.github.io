You are one of the Desert Wolfkin, a tribe of werewolf descendants who live in the hot desert wastelands of the north. This provides you with 25% immunity to heat damage and 1 point of heat auto-absorb for every point you have in Mettle. If your Mettle exceeds 10, then only every second point beyond that counts (so a Mettle of 12 would give only 11 auto-absorb against heat damage).

The Desert Wolfkin are furious and relentless fighters. The Attack and Defence bonuses you gain from rage talents, powers and spells are doubled. If you have Feral Spirit, Extended Rage adds another +5 Damage per rank while raging.

If you have Lupine Fortitude and are transformed into wolf or wolfman form, each rank in Lupine Fortitude provides +2% heat armour instead of +1%.
