The Wendigo is a gaunt giant, with ash grey skin, deeply sunken eyes and bloody
tattered lips.  It hungers for human flesh, but is never sated, for it always
grows in proportion to the meal it has just eaten.

Macabre Feast grants you +4 Attack, Damage and bypass per rank instead of the
usual +2 per rank.  Furthermore, your bite will also burst on a regular hit.

Powerful Metabolism no longer allows you to digest food at twice normal rate.

There is no longer a limit on how much food you can digest.  You may add '$e'
to your prompt to show how much you've eaten, with every 100 points increasing
your Size by +1 (up to a maximum of +10).  This timer will decrease by 1 point
per second, but won't go down while you have an adrenaline rush.

Your innate cold and poison immunity is doubled (see 'help innate').
