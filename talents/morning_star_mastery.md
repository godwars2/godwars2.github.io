This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Flails skill when using a morning
star.  This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added
afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or
skill maximum).  Note also that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for
take half damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their
encumbrance reduced by one.
