This talent makes your claws as sharp as razor blades. When using natural claw attacks, you gain +1 Attack for each point of Grace and Wits you have (added as if it were a natural weapon bonus). Your natural claw attacks also receive +1 cut bypass for each point of Tenacity you have (see 'help bypass'). If your stats exceed 10, then only every second point beyond that counts (so a Tenacity of 12 would give your claws +11 cut bypass, while a Grace of 20 would give +15 Attack, and so on).
