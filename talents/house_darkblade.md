You are a member of House DarkBlade, one of the great vampire orders. This allows you to conjure a blade of shimmering darkness via the 'conjure' command, which you can use to deadly effect in combat. House DarkBlade are the masters of this weapon, and you therefore gain a +25 bonus to your Swords skill when wielding a darkblade (although this bonus won't appear in your score). You also gain the ability to wear up to 5 items each with 10 Shadow Taint.

The weapon can also be transformed into an ethereal blade of writhing shadow which causes cold damage, and can shoot beams of cold energy at your opponents.

Many members of House DarkBlade are deadly assassins - if you have the Assassin Training talent, you'll be able to use your darkblade to perform backstabs and slit throats, and your stealth ability will provide rank 5 invisibility. If you are a full vampire and also have the Cloak of Shadows power, this talent in combination with Assassin Training will enhance the invisibility and Defence bonuses of your Cloak of Shadows by an additional 5 ranks.
