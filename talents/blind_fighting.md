Most people suffer a penalty to their defence when fighting an opponent they
can't see, giving them -25% if the opponent is partially visible and -50% if
completely invisible.  This talent represents the supernatural ability to sense
incoming attacks, negating all visibility penalties.

In addition, you are able to see partially visible people as if they were fully
visible, and fully invisible people as if they were partially invisible, unless
their invisibility is more than 5 ranks higher than your detection.

Finally, while your eyes are closed (see 'help close'), you are able to sense
other creatures as if they were partially visible.  Once again, this doesn't
apply if their invisibility is more than 5 ranks higher than your detection.
