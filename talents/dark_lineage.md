One of your ancestors was a vampire, and you have discovered how to draw upon
the supernatural power of your mixed blood.  While still far weaker than a
true vampire, you are able to utilise some of their minor abilities.

You can use the 'claws' command to extend or retract your claws.

You can use the 'hr' (head regenerate) command to heal injuries.  This can also
be enhanced by typing 'hr+' (see 'help regenerate' for details).  Furthermore,
while healing at full speed your body will automatically repair minor wounds
such as broken bones as if you had 5 ranks in Regeneration (this bonus stacks).

You can use the 'hb' (head bite) command to perform a bite attack, which causes
stabbing damage and restores 1-5 points of mana (or 2-10 on a critical hit).
