This talent provides you with particularly thick fur when using Beasthide or
Dragonhide, although the latter only applies while in Dragon Form; although
most dragons are hairless, a small minority have fur or feathers.

The duration of your Beasthide or Dragonhide is doubled, and while it is active
you gain a bonus to Defence equal to twice the Resistance bonus, as well as a
spell armour bonus of +10% to all locations against physical damage.

In addition, the mana cost for boosting Beasthide or Dragonhide is reduced by
half, the casting time is reduced from 2 seconds to 1, and the AP cost reduced
from 75 to 50.
