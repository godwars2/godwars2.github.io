You are a member of House BloodStone, one of the great vampire orders.  This
allows you to infuse metal weapons and armour with your blood via the 'forge'
command, transforming them into a heavy yet durable metal called bloodsteel.

Whenever you hit someone with a bloodsteel weapon, it soaks up blood, making it
throb and eventually pulsate, and this talent allows you to utilise that stolen
lifeforce.  While the weapon is pulsating you gain a bypass bonus equal to your
Tenacity.  This bypass bonus is halved when the weapon is only throbbing (so
a Tenacity of 30 would give only +15 bypass).

If you are a full vampire with the Blood Forging power, the above bypass bonus
stacks with the ranked bypass bonus.  Your power is also treated as if it were
5 ranks higher for the purposes of wearing and forging (but not for bypass).
