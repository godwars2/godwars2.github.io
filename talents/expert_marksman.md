This talent greatly improves your attacks when firing a longbow, shortbow or crossbow at long range. A ranged weapon usually gives your opponent a +1 bonus to Defence (applied after all other modifiers) for each foot of distance beyond the first ten. With this talent, the bonus is reduced to +1 Defence for every five feet of distance beyond the first hundred. In addition, the half-damage penalty for attacks made at over half the maximum range is no longer applied.

This talent also lowers both your reload and aiming times by 1 second.
