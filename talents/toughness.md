Your skin is tough, and your body naturally able to shrug off damage. You have a +10% bonus to Resistance, applied directly after primary stats, and applied separately from any style percentage bonus. You also gain natural auto-absorb equal to your Mettle against crush damage, half of that against cut and stab damage, and a quarter of that against heat, cold, shock and poison damage. If your Mettle exceeds 10 then only every second point beyond that counts (so a Mettle of 12 would give only 11 auto-absorb against crush damage). To learn how auto-absorb works, see 'help armour'.
