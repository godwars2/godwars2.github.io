This talent gives you a +30% Damage bonus when using the Bull basic fighting style, a +25% Damage bonus when using the Bear, Eagle, Tiger or Dragon advanced fighting styles, a +20% Damage bonus when using the Hawk, Lion, Rhino, Hydra, Leopard or Wolf super fighting styles, and a +15% Damage bonus when using any other fighting style. These bonuses do not show up in your score, but are instead added afterwards (meaning that they don't count towards improvement difficulty or fighting style maximum). In addition, when using one of the 11 fighting styles listed above, all style-specific combat techniques gain a +10% bonus to their Attack, Defence and Damage. Note that this technique bonus is automatically applied to your combat table, and does not stack with technique bonuses granted from other Style Mastery talents.
