This talent indicates that you possess psionics, granting you access to a range
of mental powers which work in much the same way as magic.  These powers are
available as 'head' abilities, and you can view a list of those available by
typing 'h?'.  These spells are Forcefield, Mind Blast, Invisibility, Detect
Invisibility and Regenerate.

In addition, while performing basic 'palm' techniques with your bare hands you
will maintain a psychokinetic barrier capable of blocking all physical attacks
(although the barrier still has the usual defence cooldown).  When using magic
or necromancy, you will instead unlock a new 'barrier' technique.
