This talent provides you with upgraded techniques when using a knife, dagger, kris or stiletto in melee combat. Each non-core technique (i.e., those which require more than one command to execute) gain +10 Attack and Defence, and each command has a 25% AP cost reduction. In addition, you are able to use loose clothing as an improvised weapon in your other hand, providing you with greatly upgraded defensive techniques, and you gain the ability to draw or sheathe cloaks as if they were weapons, reflecting the style of combat popular among many knife fighters.

Your cut and stab attacks with daggers will have an innate critical bypass of 250% instead of the normal 150% (see 'help critical bypass'). You know how to hit where it hurts, and strike your opponent's armour where it's the weakest.
