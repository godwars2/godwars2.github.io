You are one of the Swamp Wolfkin, a tribe of werewolf descendants who live in
the fetid swamps and marshes.  This provides you with 25% immunity to poison
damage and 1 point of poison auto-absorb for every point you have in Mettle.
If your Mettle exceeds 10, then only every second point beyond that counts (so
a Mettle of 12 would give only 11 auto-absorb against poison damage).

The Swamp Wolfkin are greatly feared for their corrosive touch.  Your unarmed
attack will rust, rot and tarnish your opponent's clothing and armour.

If you also have the Lupine Fortitude power, and are transformed into wolf or
wolfman form, then each rank in Lupine Fortitude will provide you with +2%
poison armour instead of +1%.
