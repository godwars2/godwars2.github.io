The gargantuan stone giants were among the first children of Mother Earth,
possessing incredible strength and ferocity.  It was said that their fists
could strike with the force of a hundred mortal men, and this gave rise to
their name 'Hecatonchires', meaning 'Hundred-Handed Ones'.

Your innate crush bypass is increased to +2 per rank instead of +1 per ranks,
while your innate mental immunity is doubled (see 'help innate').

If you are an Elder Stone Giant, your innate crush bypass increases to +3 per
rank, and you gain +10% immunity vs physical damage.
