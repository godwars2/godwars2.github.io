This talent improves your unarmed hand damage by +1 for each point of Brawn you
have (added as if it were a natural weapon bonus - but only for bare hands, not
for claws or when wearing gloves or gauntlets).  It also allows you to block
melee attacks as if you were wearing bracers, and grants you a natural armour
of 25% on your hands and arms (stackable with armour in the normal way).  Your
fists also gain +10% bypass (see 'help bypass').

Your bare handed crush attacks have an innate critical bypass of 250% instead
of the usual 150% (see 'help critical bypass').
