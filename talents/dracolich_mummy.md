Over time your skin and flesh have been preserved, intentionally or otherwise, through exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air.

Your teeth and claws are infected with a horrible wasting disease called 'Tomb Rot'. Whenever they inflict a critical hit, you will automatically perform an indirect red attack spell. If successful, your opponent will suffer 1 point of damage per second for each rank you have in Fumes of the Pit, lasting a number of seconds equal to your base Tenacity. If they are already infected with Tomb Rot, its duration is extended (up to a maximum of twice your base Tenacity).

Your desiccated flesh is highly resilient, but not very flexible. Each point of Speed over your Speed Cap is converted into 2 points of Resistance, instead of the usual 1 point of Attack, Defence, Ascendancy and Protection. If you've got Lord of the Lands, you no longer receive its Speed over Speed Cap bonus.

The Resistance bonus of your Dragonhide is doubled.
