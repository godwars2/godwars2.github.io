Your soul has become a direct conduit for primordial energy, strengthening your connection to the elemental planes.

If you have one of the Adept talents, it will grant +3 bypass per rank in the associated Magic power instead of the usual +1 bypass per rank, and the natural armour bonus from Aura will be tripled.

If you don't have an Adept talent, you gain +1% natural armour vs physical and energy damage for each point of Aura you possess. In addition, you gain +1% crush, heat, cold and shock bypass per rank in Earth Magic, Fire Magic, Water Magic and Air Magic respectively.
