This talent indicates training in the art of assassination. When wielding a dagger, shortsword, darkblade, ninjatou or any mystical blade, and performing a basic thrust or slash technique at an opponent who is facing away from you, your attacks cannot be dodged or blocked (your opponent is considered to have a Defence of 1) and your total damage will be doubled.

If your backstab or throatslit is a critical hit then your opponent will also take an amount of bleeding damage per second equal to your naked Discipline, lasting a number of seconds equal to your base Discipline.

Note that you can tell when an opponent has their back to you, because their name will be highlighted red. You can also check that you're using a proper assassination weapon, as the 's' and 't' techniques will be coloured purple in your combat table (you must also have the appropriate Weapon Mastery).

This talent also provides you with a 'stealth' command, which provides you with rank 1 invisibility for 1 second per point of base Discipline, paused until you strike or get struck in combat.
