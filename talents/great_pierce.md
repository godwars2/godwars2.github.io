This talent provides you with +30 armour bypass with any piercing or stabbing
attacks you make, which is subtracted from the soak percentage of each piece
of armour it passes through until all 30 has been applied.  For example, if
your opponent had a 10% soak cap over a 50% soak coif, their cap would be
reduced to 0% soak, while their coif would be reduced to 30% soak.  This also
works against armour talents.  See 'help bypass' for more details.

If you also have the Pierce talent, both bonuses will be added together.
