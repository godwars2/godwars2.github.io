This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Shields skill when using a tower or
kite shield.  This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added
afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or
skill maximum).  Note also that your shield will take half damage when struck
in combat, and will have its encumbrance reduced by one.
