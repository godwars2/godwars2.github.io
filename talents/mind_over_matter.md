Through mental discipline you have learned to control and overcome physical
pain.  Your pain penalties (see 'help pain') are reduced from -50% to -25%
when at less than 25% Health, from -25% to -12% when at less than 50% Health
and from -10% to -5% when at less than 75% Health.  In addition, your mental
discipline provides you with a +10 bonus to Protection, which is added before
percentages modifiers, and natural mental armour of 25% to all locations.
