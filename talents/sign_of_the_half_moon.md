Those born under the waning or waxing moon are able to further strengthen their spiritual ties. Your birth sign is that of the half moon, which refers to both the first- and third-quarter moons, and represents the neutral voice of reason between the two extremes of full and dark moon. Your balanced perspective of the world makes you a natural leader among your kind.
