This talent indicates that you have a strong barrier in your mind, giving you
a bonus of +50 Protection against mental attacks, and a natural mental immunity
rating of 50% on all locations.  Because the barrier is subconscious, pain
penalties do not apply when calculating your Protection rating.  Unfortunately
the barrier works both ways, preventing you from ever learning psionic powers
and giving you a -25 penalty to Ascendancy should you ever learn magic, as well
as preventing you from ever using mindthrust techniques should you gain mental
powers through some other means.  The Protection bonus and Ascendancy penalty
are added before percentage modifiers.
