This talent reduces your AP cost for rapier and main gauche commands by 10, and
enhances many of the combat techniques.  In addition, loose clothing used as an
improvised weapon receives greatly improved defensive techniques while you are
using a rapier in the other hand, and you gain the ability to draw or sheathe
cloaks as if they were weapons, reflecting a style of combat popular among many
duellists.

Your cut and stab attacks with rapiers and main gauches have an innate critical
bypass of 250% instead of the usual 150% (see 'help critical bypass').  You
hit where it hurts, and strike your opponent's armour where it's the weakest.
