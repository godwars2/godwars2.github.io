This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Swords skill when using a ninjatou, a +25 bonus to your Daggers skill when using a shuriken, and a +25 bonus to your Axes skill when using a kama. This bonus will not show up in score, but is instead added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill maximum). Note also that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for take half damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their encumbrance reduced by one.
