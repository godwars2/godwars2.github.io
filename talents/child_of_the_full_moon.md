You were born under the full moon, and the primal strength of Fenris Wolf runs through your veins. As you've grown older and more powerful, the intensity of your lycanthropic rage has increased far beyond that of most werewolves.

Your Spirit of Fenris power grants you an additional +5 Damage per rank, as does your Lesser Totem Spirit power when calling upon the Boar spirit.

In addition, your Extended Rage rank is doubled for the purposes of overcoming fear spells and powers, such as Thundering Roar or Living Nightmare.

Finally, while raging you are completely immune to auras of fear or terror.
