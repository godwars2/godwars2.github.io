You have attained an instinctive mastery over the mists that separate the lands
of the living from the lands of the dead.

If you have Mist Form or Shadow Infusion, you get an 'ht' (head travel) command
which allows you to travel up to 5000 feet, +5000 feet per rank.  This replaces
your normal travel, if any, and works for all forms except Bat Form.
