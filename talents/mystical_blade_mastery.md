This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Swords skill when using one of the four mystical epic blades; flameblade, frostblade, stormblade and spiritblade. This bonus will not show up in your score, but added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill maximum). Note also that weapons you have the appropriate Mastery for take half damage when they strike other weapons in combat, and have their encumbrance reduced by one.
