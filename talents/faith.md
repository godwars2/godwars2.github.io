Your unshakable belief in divine powers has provided a minor focus for your own
Supernaturalis soul, allowing you to wield minor magical abilities when holding
a holy symbol.  Such faith is not possible for those who unravel the secrets of
real magic, as they are no longer able to delude themselves.  Those who embrace
their darker heritage are also unable to attain such a blind faith in goodness.

For lycanthropes and their kin, Faith takes on a slightly different meaning, as
it represents their trust and confidence in the animal spirits from which they
draw much of their knowledge and wisdom.  The animal spirits often reward this
dedication with minor magical abilities, which once again require a holy symbol
to be held - most commonly a fang necklace.

This talent gives you the Sanctuary, Mystic Armour, Bless, Lay On Hands and
Righteous Fury spells.
