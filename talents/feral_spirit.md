One of your ancestors was a werewolf, and you have discovered how to draw upon the supernatural power of your mixed blood. While still far weaker than a true werewolf, you are able to utilise some of their minor abilities.

You can use the 'talons' command to extend or retract your talons.

You can use the 'hd' (head beasthide) command to grow thick fur, giving you a Resistance bonus based on your Green Magic skill and allowing you to use a third of your feet defence during cooldown. This can also be enhanced (by typing 'hd+'), which makes it permanent and increases the Resistance bonus.

You can use the 'hb' (head bite) command to perform a bite attack, which causes crushing damage and provides you with a mouthful of flesh (see 'help eat').

You can leap up to 300 feet when unencumbered or lightly encumbered, using the 'fj' (feet jump) command three times in sequence (i.e., 'fj', 'fj', 'fj').
