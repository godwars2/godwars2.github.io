This talent gives you a +25 bonus to your Shields skill when using a buckler, target shield or crescent shield. This bonus will not show up in your score, but is instead added afterwards (meaning that it isn't counted towards improvement difficulty or skill maximum). Note also that your buckler or shield will take half damage when it strikes or is struck in combat, and will have its encumbrance reduced by one.
