This talent improves your ability to fight with the quarterstaff, enhancing
many of the available techniques in various different ways, such as reducing
their execution speed, improving their attack, defence and damage, giving an
innate bypass bonus, or inflicting specialised wounds on a critical hit.

Your quarterstaff gains an innate critical bypass of 250% instead of the normal
150% for all physical damage (see 'help critical bypass').  You know how to hit
where it hurts, and strike your opponent's armour where it's the weakest.
