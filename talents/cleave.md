This talent provides you with +20 armour bypass with any slashing or cutting attacks you make, which is subtracted from the soak percentage of each piece of armour it passes through until all 20 has been applied. For example, if your opponent had a 10% soak cap over a 50% soak coif, their cap would be reduced to 0% soak, while their coif would be reduced to 40% soak. This also works against armour talents. See 'help bypass' for more details.
