This talent increases the Power of your spells by 50%, applied directly to the spell table itself. For example, if you were casting a firebolt which had a +10 base Power bonus, this talent would increase that bonus to +15. You can see the adjusted base bonus when you view your spell table by typing 'l?' or 'r?' - or 'h?', if you have psionic offensive powers.

Ranged spells usually only inflict half damage when made at over half maximum range. With this talent, the half-damage penalty is no longer applied.
