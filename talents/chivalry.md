This talent allows you to summon a warhorse to serve as a mount, and a falcon to serve as a weapon. To summon a warhorse, use 'hs' (head summon), followed by 'hh' (head horse) to specify the mount type. To summon a falcon, use the 'fg' hand combo (eg 'rf' then 'rg' to summon it with your right hand).

If you are a full vampire and know the Ember rune (see 'help Blood Runes'), you will summon a nightmare instead of a warhorse. All bonuses which apply to your warhorse will also apply to the nightmare, but the nightmare will also provide additional attack types and bonuses.
