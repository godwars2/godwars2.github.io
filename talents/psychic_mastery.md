This talent indicates that you have mastered your psychic and psionic powers, reducing the action point cost from 75 to 50 for each associated command and providing a number of other boosts, such as shorter casting time and enhanced bonuses.

Your psionics invisibility spell will be replaced with veiled presence, which works in the same way except that it stacks with other forms of invisibility.

Note that this talent also upgrades your psychokinetic barrier, and reduces its cooldown by 1.
