Werewolves and dragons are both able to assume a hybrid form, but it usually
requires discipline to pause their transformation half way.  Those with this
talent have a natural affinity for assuming their hybrid forms.

While transformed into wolfman or draconian form, each rank in Self Control or
Draconian Form grants you +1 Attack, Defence, Damage, Ascendancy, Protection,
Power and Resistance, as well as +1 bypass and +5 Health.

Furthermore, the immunity granted by Lupine Fortitude (while in wolfman form)
and Draconian Form will be capped at rank 30, rather than rank 20.
