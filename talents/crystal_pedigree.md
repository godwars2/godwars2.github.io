You are a purebreed dragon, descended from one of the Crystal bloodlines. The Crystal dragons were the first to discover the secrets of draconic elemental magic, which they wield with unparallelled skill and power.

You get +1 heat, cold and shock hand bypass per rank in Fires of the Volcano, Chill of the Tundra and Eye of the Storm respectively.

If you have Elemental Spell Focus, the above bypass bonuses are doubled to +2 per rank, and your Heat Wave, Cold Wave and Shock Wave spell sigils have a 1% chance per (above Magic power) rank of inflicting a burst on a critical hit.

If you have Great Burn, Great Freeze or Great Shock, the associated Wave spell will have a 2% chance per rank of inflicting a burst on a critical hit.

As with all purebreed dragons, your scales are stronger than normal. Each rank in Dragon Form gives you +1% armour vs cut, stab and crush damage, +3% armour vs heat, cold and shock damage, and +4% armour vs mental damage.

Note that these bonuses only apply while you are in Dragon Form.

### Colouring
