This talent increases the range of all your spells by 50%. This modifier is applied after the appropriate magic colour, not added like most percentage bonuses are - so if you have a base range of 100', increased to 200' because of your magic colour, this talent would increase the 200' by an additional 50% giving you a total range of 300'. Any magical bonuses to range are still applied afterwards, however, and touch-ranged spells are not increased.

Ranged spells usually give your opponent a +1 Defence bonus for every foot of distance beyond the first ten. With this talent, the bonus is reduced to +1 Defence for every five feet of distance beyond the first hundred.
