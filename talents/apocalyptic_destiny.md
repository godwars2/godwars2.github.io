You have delved into the secrets of the apocalypse, forging a dark destiny for yourself. This gives you access to a range of hand-based spells, which can be activated by typing 'necromancy'.

As a necromancer you do not receive the standard spells available to most spellcasters. Instead, you gain Summon Zombie, Summon Skeleton, Summon Wight, Empower Undead, Death Ward and Spectral Shield.
