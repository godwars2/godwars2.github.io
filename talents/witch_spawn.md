Through careful research, dark deals and binding pacts, you have uncovered the deep secrets of infernal witchcraft. This provides you with access to a range of hand-based spells, which you can activate by typing 'magic'. As well as providing the standard spells, this talent also gives you Hellfire Bolt, Summon Guardian, Fireblade and Dark Blessing.

If you are also a demon, your Pathway to Hell power will unlock additional spells as you gain ranks.
