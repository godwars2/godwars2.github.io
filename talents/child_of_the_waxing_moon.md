You were born under the waxing moon, granting you considerable influence among
the spirits.  As you've grown older and more powerful, you've learned to use
this influence to manipulate the lesser beings of the spirit plane.

Your ranked bonuses from Lesser Totem Spirit are doubled, including the range
of the Owl spirit, although the duration of these bonuses is unchanged.

If you have Spirit Binding, you can wear up to four bound spirits per rank
without penalty, rather than the normal three per rank.  Furthermore, each
spirit beyond that is treated as only 10 points of radiation, rather than 15.

Finally, this talent gives you a bonus of +5 ranks in Spirit Binding.
