This talent allows you to enter a berserk rage, which lasts a number of seconds equal to three times your base Mettle. This grants you a bonus to Speed equal to your base Tenacity, and a bonus to Attack, Defence and Damage equal to your naked Brawn. Note that 'naked' includes only base, class and trained stats.

Furthermore, while in a rage you don't suffer pain penalties (see 'help pain').

Once your rage has ended, you will suffer -5 Speed and -10 Attack, Defence and Damage. This exhaustion penalty will last for 30 seconds.

To activate this talent, type 'rage'.
