This talent indicates that you have learned how to build a strong psychic wall
within your mind, helping you block mental probes and attacks.  This provides
you with natural mental immunity of 25% on all locations.  It also grants a +25
bonus to Protection, added before percentages, and - because the mental defence
is automatic - pain penalties will no longer reduce the result.  Note that this
talent also upgrades your psychokinetic barrier, and reduces its cooldown by 1.
