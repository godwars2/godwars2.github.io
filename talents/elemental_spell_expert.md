This talent provides you with +25% critical bypass for all heat, cold and shock spells you cast, including psionic spells as well as those cast from wands and other devices.

If you have Burn, Freeze and/or Shock, the critical bypass is increased to +50% for the appropriate damage type, and you gain a further +1 bypass per rank in Fire Magic, Water Magic and/or Air Magic respectively (although once again this bypass bonus only applies when casting spells).

See 'help critical-bypass' for more details on how critical bypass works.
