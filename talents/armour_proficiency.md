You are experienced at moving and fighting in armour, and therefore suffer the speed and cooldown penalties for encumbrance as if you were at one encumbrance level lighter (see 'help encumbrance'). You still suffer the usual -1 Defence for each point of encumbrance, and continue to use the appropriate combat table for your actual encumbrance level, although you now have the ability to recover from sweeps while at medium encumbrance (but not at heavy).

Note that when you have this talent, the encumbrance value in your score will be followed by a '*', colour-coded to represent the encumbrance level at which your speed and cooldown are calculated.

This talent also raises your maximum post-bypass soak percentage to 80% for all worn armour (see 'help armour'), although it won't help natural armour.
