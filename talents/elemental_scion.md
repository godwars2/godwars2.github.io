You have dedicated your spirit to one of the four elements, and become a full
elemental being.  Your Adept talent determines which type of elemental you have
become, and you can no longer assume any of the other three elemental Forms.

Your elemental Form gains 100% immunity to poison damage.  Form of Fire, Water
and Air also gain 100% immunity to heat, cold and shock damage respectively.

If you have Immanence, the spill-over immunity bonuses are doubled, except for
those from your opposed elemental form (Earth opposes Air, Fire opposes Water).

You gain +2 bypass per rank based on your elemental Form power - Fire, Water,
Air and Earth give heat, cold, shock and crush bypass respectively.  You also
get +100% critical bypass for all attacks you make if it uses this damage type.

Note that these bonuses only apply while you are in your elemental Form.
