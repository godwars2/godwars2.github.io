The axe is a deadly weapon in the hands of an expert, becoming very difficult to predictably defend against. This talent doubles your chance of scoring a critical hit from 5% to 10%, and results in your other successful hits causing a larger percentage of your maximum damage - see 'help critical'. Note that a critical hit always hits and will always cause maximum damage (before armour), regardless of how good your opponent is at defending themselves.

Combined with Large Axe Mastery, this talent gives the ability to parry double attacks when using a large axe two handed. Combined with Small Axe Mastery, this talent reduces the AP cost of all small axe commands by 10, and the cost of the 'aim' and 'throw' commands for throwing axes by 25. Combined with Ninja Blade Mastery, the kama gains the same benefits as a small axe.
