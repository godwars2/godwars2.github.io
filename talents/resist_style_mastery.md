This talent gives a +30% Resistance bonus when using the Crab basic fighting style, a +25% Resistance bonus when using the Swallow, Dragon, Fox or Scorpion advanced fighting styles, a +20% Resistance bonus when using the Wolf, Rhino, Ape, Serpent, Hydra or Flea super fighting styles, and a +15% Resistance bonus when using any other fighting style. These bonuses do not show up in your score, but are instead added afterwards (meaning they don't count towards improvement difficulty or fighting style maximum). In addition, when using one of the 11 fighting styles listed above, all style-specific combat techniques gain a +10% bonus to their Attack, Defence and Damage. Note that this technique bonus is automatically applied to your combat table, and does not stack with technique bonuses granted from other Style Mastery talents.
