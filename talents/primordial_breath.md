You are able to breathe primordial energy at your opponent by typing 'hc' (head concentrate) followed by 'hb' (head bite). This will be treated as a ranged physical attack, and it gains the same bonuses as Precise Throw.

The type of breath depends on your Lesser Calling. Fire Giants breathe fire, Frost Giants breathe frost and Storm Giants breathe lightning.
