This talent increases the Ascendancy of your spells by 50%, applied directly to the spell table itself. For example, if you were casting a firebolt which had a +20 base Ascendancy bonus, this talent would increase that bonus to +30. You can see the adjusted base bonus when you view your spell table by typing 'l?' or 'r?' - or 'h?', if you have psionic offensive powers.
