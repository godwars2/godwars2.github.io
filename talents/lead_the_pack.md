This talent allows you to summon a second wolf (via the Summon Wolf power) or hellhound (via the Hellhound power). The second canine will be the same age as the first one, with the same stats, powers and talents, however its skills and styles will start at 0 and need to be trained independently.

Whenever one of your canines raises a stat, so will the other. Furthermore, if you are shapechanged into the form of a wolf or hellhound and kill an opponent of at least half your canines' age, they will both raise a stat as if they were the ones who had earned the kill - and also get an auto-advance point each, if their age is equal or less than that of the opponent you killed; your packmates learn faster when you're setting an example for them to follow.
