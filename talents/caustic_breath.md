Your acidic breath is particularly potent, and burns like liquid fire, causing
dual poison/heat damage (see 'help dual damage').  This applies to both your
physical and magical breath attacks, although the former inflicts poison damage
if both types are equal, while the latter inflicts heat.  This benefit applies
to all forms (as well as your mount, if any), but only when using acid breath.

Your acid breath attack gains an additional +1 poison and heat bypass per rank
in Fumes of the Pit, and +1 heat bypass per rank in Fires of the Volcano.  If
your acid breath comes from a Draconian or Hydra infusion, any poison bypass
granted to your breath attack by the wisdom also applies to your heat bypass.
