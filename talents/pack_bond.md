This talent allows your packmates to draw upon your supernatural might when you join them in canine form (i.e., while shapechanged into a wolf or hellhound).

As a vampire, your wolf packmates gain the same rank as you in Path of Shadows, Shadow Infusion and Blood Runes. They will use the same runes as you.

As a werewolf, your wolf packmates gain the same rank as you in Ride the Storm, Storm Talons and Lunar Tattoos. They will use the same tattoos as you.

As a demon, your hellhound packmates gain the same rank as you in Pathway to Hell, Inferno and a Tail power, using the two tails you don't have. They use the same warps as you for visage, head, eyes, mouth, wings, tail and inferno.

Note that these bonuses only apply when in your canine (or giant bat) form.
