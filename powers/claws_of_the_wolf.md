Vampires possess the innate ability to grow razor-sharp wolf-like claws from
their fingertips.  This power strengthens those claws further, with each rank
granting +3 Attack, +2 Damage and +1 bypass, added in the same way as weapon
bonuses.  When in Wolf Form, each rank also gives an additional +1 bypass to
your talons, giving a total of +3 Attack, +2 Damage and +2 bypass per rank.
