You have learned how to brand symbols of cosmic power into your equipment,
using the 'brand' command.  Doing this on an item that is already branded will
increase or decrease the branding strength to your current rank, or strip the 
branding entirely if it is already the same strength as your current rank.

Each item may only contain one of the following branding types:

- Sun    : Heat burst/bypass for weapons.  +2 heat soak for armour.
- Moon   : Cold burst/bypass for weapons.  +2 cold soak for armour.
- Earth  : Crush burst/bypass for weapons.  +1 physical soak for armour.
- Sky    : Shock burst/bypass for weapons.  +2 shock soak for armour.
- Chaos  : Energy burst/bypass for weapons.  +1 energy soak for armour.

The 'burst/bypass' is a +5% chance of causing an burst attack on a critical hit
and +1 bypass for the burst, with Chaos inflicting a random energy burst each 
time it hits.  Armour also gains an absorb bonus equal to half its soak.

Each point of Cosmic Branding exceeding your rank counts as 10 radiation.
