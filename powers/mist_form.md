This power allows you to transform yourself into sentient mist.  Physically
you still appear to be human, although your form becomes transparent and coils
of mist continually rise from your body, swirling around you.  While in this
hybrid form you gain 5% immunity to all forms of physical damage and 30%
immunity to cold and poison damage.  You may still use equipment and weapons
as normal, as long as they are made from shadowcloth or shadowsteel.  Each rank
you have in this power gives +2 Mana, +2 Ascendancy and +2 Protection.  Each of
your first 20 ranks also give +1% immunity to physical and poison damage.
