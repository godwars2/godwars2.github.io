Every werewolf is able to transform into wolfman form.  In this form you gain
10% immunity to all forms of damage, and your movement rate is increased by 2
when walking and 5 when jogging or running.  Your default hands locations will
be set to the claws combat table, and your head and feet will be changed to
wolfman-specific combat tables.  Type 'wolfman' to assume wolfman form.

This power represents your ability to control your shapechanging gifts further,
with each rank granting +2 Protection, +1 Resistance, +1 Damage and +1 Power
while in wolfman or wolf form.  While in wolf form you also gain +1 Attack, +1
Defence and +1 bypass per rank.  While in wolfman form, you gain +1% natural
armour per rank vs all damage, and +1 Size for every 10 full ranks.

If you enter a rage while shapechanged, this power will enhance your rage bonus
with an additional +5 Resistance, +5 Protection and +1% Health per rank.

At rank 5, you no longer suffer penalties while shapechanging.  At rank 10,
you gain the ability to shift directly between forms, rather than having to
change back to human form first.  At rank 15 you are able to shapechange in 4
seconds rather than 5, while at rank 20 you can shapechange in only 3 seconds.
