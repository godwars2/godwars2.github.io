This power indicates that you have allied yourself with a greater bear spirit.
Your natural talons gain +1 Attack, +1 Damage and +1 bypass for each rank you
have in this power.  Equally, while in wolfman or wolf form, your pelt becomes
thicker and tougher, granting +1% natural armour per rank vs physical damage.

At rank 10, the bear spirit turns your pain into aggression.  While raging, you
gain bonuses to Attack and Defence equal to the pain penalty you would normally
suffer (see 'help pain'), meaning that the more hurt you are the more dangerous
you become (you gain +0%, +10%, +25% or +50% Attack/Defence).

At rank 20, your aggression is increased even further.  The above pain bonuses
are doubled, giving +0%, +20%, +50% or +100% Attack/Defence while raging.

Note that you may still call the aid of a Lesser Totem Spirit as usual.
