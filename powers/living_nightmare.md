This power allows you to inspire fear in your nemesis, becoming their worst
nightmare.  This is a head-based mental attack which fills the victim with fear
if it causes damage, unless their rank in their Rage power exceeds your rank in
Living Nightmare.  Note that Berserker Rage and Tireless Rage each increase the
effective Rage rank of the victim by 5 for the purposes of resisting the fear.

The fear gives -5 Attack and Defence per rank, and lasts 10 seconds, +2 seconds
per rank.  The victim will be unable to activate any rage powers, and suffers 
-2% and -1% spell armour per rank for one physical and one energy damage type 
respectively, based on your Protean Nemesis bypass type at the time of activing
this power.  Note that the spell armour layer cannot be reduced below 0% soak.

If someone is already in a Rage when struck by this power, they also add their 
Extended Rage to their effective Rage rank for resisting the fear effect of 
your Living Nightmare.  If you still beat them, their rage is stripped away. 

You also get a +2% and +1% bonus per rank to your physical and energy protean 
armour (although this cannot exceed your rank in Protean Nemesis), and the fear
attack gets a natural bypass bonus at rank 10, upgraded at ranks 20 and 30.

If you have Psionics you gain +1 mental bypass per rank, or +2 if you also have
Psychic Mastery.  Psychic Wall gives +1% mental immunity per rank (+20% max).
