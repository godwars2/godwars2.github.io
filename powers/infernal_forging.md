This power allows you to reforge metal weapons and armour within the fiery pits
of hell, imbuing them with unholy strength and energy.  Non-magical items are 
transformed into non-magical demonsteel, while magical armour becomes tainted, 
transforming into true demonic steel; black, grey, purple, red and brass, for 
magical, legendary, mythical, relics and artifacts respectively.

If the item you forge is a full helm, breastplate, codpiece, bracers, greaves, 
gauntlets, boots or wing-spikes, it will receive bonuses specific to that item 
type.  Other types of armour have their soak and auto-absorb bonus increased, 
or gain physical soak if they have no existing magical soak bonus.  Demonic 
weapons gain a bypass bonus (although, like armour, only if they are magical).

You may reforge the item at any time - its power will be brought in line with 
your current rank.  If you wear an item with a taint higher than your rank in 
this power, each point of difference will count as 10 radiation.
