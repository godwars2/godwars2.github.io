This power allows you to travel back and forth between the spirit plane and
the material plane via the 'ride' command.  It takes 30 seconds to shift
between planes, and engaging in combat will disrupt your attempt.

Because of your close association with the spirit plane, you gain +1% immunity,
+2% armour and +1 auto-absorb per rank against shock damage.  In addition, you
gain +1 bypass per rank for all shock-based attacks you make.

If you also have the Spirit Wolfkin talent, the above bonuses are doubled, and
each rank in this power will also give you +10 range, +2 Ascendancy and +1
Power to each of the spells granted by Spirit Wolfkin, as well as increase
their duration and stat bonuses by the equivalent of 5 ranks.

If you have access to magic, this power will give you the Spiritshield, Spirit
Bolt and Lightning Bolt spells.  At rank 3 you also get Lightning Stream.  At
rank 8 you get Resist Energy (shock).  At rank 10 you get Shockshield.  Your
rank is also used to determine the strength of your Invisibility and Detect
Invisibility spells.
