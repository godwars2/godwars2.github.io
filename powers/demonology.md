This power strengthens all demonic creatures you summon, as long as you also
have at least 10 ranks in the appropriate summoning power.

If you summon a hellhound, it will gain a number of ranks in Feral Senses and 
Tainted Talons equal to your rank in this power, and half that in Regeneration.
Your hellhound also gains new talents based on your rank: Ambidextrous at rank 
1, Iron Talons at rank 5, Cleave at rank 10, Powerful Metabolism at rank 15, 
Great Cleave at rank 20, Fiend Spawn at rank 30 and Tainted Soul at rank 40.

If you summon an imp, your first 10 ranks in this power will each give it +10% 
health.  Every rank beyond 10 will add +1 Grace, Wits, Tenacity, Discipline and
Aura in the same way as a rank of Imp Servant.  Your imp automatically has the 
Tainted Soul, Magically Gifted and Instinctive Dodge talents, but as you gain 
ranks in this power it will also gain new talents: Burn at rank 5, Improved 
Spell Attack at rank 10, Great Burn at rank 15, Improved Spell Damage at rank 
20, Witch Spawn at rank 25 and Evasion at rank 30.  It also gains a number of
ranks in Pathway to Hell and Tainted Flesh equal to your rank in this power.

If you summon a Warbeast it will be winged, allowing you to fly distances of up
to 5000 feet, plus an extra 5000 feet per rank in Demonology.  Your feet also 
gain +3 bypass per rank while riding a warbeast.  If you've applied a warp to 
your wings for Demon Form, your warbeast will get the same warp.
