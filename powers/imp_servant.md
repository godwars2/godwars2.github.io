This power allows you to summon an imp servant, who will assist you in combat 
by shooting bolts of hellfire at your enemies.  Your imp's skills and styles 
improve in the same way as a PC, and if killed it may be resummoned back at 
your home plane without any loss of progress.  Your imp will follow simple 
verbal commands such as 'kill' and 'heal' (see 'help pets').

In addition, you may also order your imp to perch on your shoulder (you can do
this by typing 'say to imp perch').  While on your shoulder the imp will inform
you whenever it senses a death or power surge (the latter of which is caused by
someone shifting into the Nexus), calculated in the same way as Feral Senses.
Furthermore, you may also use the 'i?' command to control your imp while it is 
perched, and the 'warp' command to change the type of imp you summon.

Each rank you have in this power will give your imp +1 to each of Grace, Wits, 
Tenacity, Discipline and Aura.  Your imp also has a number of ranks in Ears of 
the Bat equal to your rating in this power.
