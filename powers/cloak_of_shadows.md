This power allows you to draw the shadows around you, concealing you from sight
and helping to deflect incoming attacks.  Each rank in this power increases the
strength of your invisibility by 1, and provides +10 Defence and +1% armour vs
physical damage.  The cloak lasts for 10 seconds per rank, starting the first
time you're struck, and cannot be initiated while you have an adrenaline rush.

In addition, Cloak of Shadows will help conceal the death aura of your kills,
with each rank reducing the range at which your kills can be sensed by 25 feet
for full information and 75 feet for partial - effectively, a shield against
those who use powers such as Ears of the Bat or Feral Senses.

To activate your Cloak of Shadows, type 'cloak'.
