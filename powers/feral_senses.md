This power allows you to sense invisible creatures around you, as long as you
have at least as many ranks in this power as they have in their invisibility
power.  In addition, you gain the ability to sense the aura of death - every
time a player kills a monster within 500 feet, plus 5 feet for every monster
they've killed the current day, plus 25 feet per rank you have in this power,
you will be able to sense their approximate distance and direction.  You will
also sense the approximate direction (but not distance) of kills made at up
to three times that range.

Your reflexes and reactions also increase to superhuman levels, giving +2 Speed
and +1 Speed Cap per rank.  At rank 20, while your action points are at 66% or
above all techniques with a delay of 4+ seconds will have that delay reduced by
1 second.  At rank 30 your action points only need to be at 33% or above, and
techniques with a delay of 3 seconds will also have their delay reduced by 1.

This power also gives you access to the 'scent' command, which has the same
range as your death/power sense, and will reveal the approximate distance and
direction of the nearest creature within range.  Every 10 ranks will allow you
to sense an additional creature (eg at rank 20 you can sense the nearest 3).
