This power grants you access to a range of water spells.  Each rank gives you
+10 range, +2 Ascendancy and +1 Power to each water spell, and also increases
the duration and stat bonuses of water spell affects.

A single rank in this power will give you the Icebolt spell.  At rank 2 you
learn Frost.  At rank 4 you learn Iceblade.  At rank 5 you learn Icestorm.  At
rank 8 you learn Resist Energy (cold).  At rank 10 you learn Iceshield and a
second Icebolt.  At rank 25 you learn Temporal Lock and Temporal Shift.

At rank 15 you gain a regrow command on your stumps, which allows you to regrow
new hands.  If you also have the Waterborn Adept talent, you instead gain this
ability at rank 10.
