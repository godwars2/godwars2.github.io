While most dragons scorn armour in favour of their natural hide and scales, a
handful have embraced the concept.  These modern-thinking dragons no longer
collect and guard treasure, but instead wear it in the form of magical barding.

This power allows you to wear up to five pieces of armour; a champron on your
head and face, a criniere on your neck, a peytral on your chest, flanchards on
your back and flanks, and a croupiere on your rump.  You may also wear a pair
of wing-spikes, two pairs of dragonspurs and two rings - a total of ten items.
You gain additional bonuses based on the materials of the items, as follows:

Gold       | Gives +1 Damage and Power per item, per rank.
Silver     | Gives +2 Attack and Ascendancy per item, per rank.
Copper     | Gives +1 Speed per item, per rank.
Bronze     | Gives +2 Defence and Protection per item, per rank.
Brass      | Gives +5 Health and Mana per item, per rank.
Platinum   | Gives +2 Resistance per item, per rank.

You can view your bonuses by typing 'barding'.  Note that you may also choose
to wear a saddle and bridle, although these do not give the above bonuses.
