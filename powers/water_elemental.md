This power allows you to summon a water elemental.  The elemental has 5 in each
stat, plus 1 Wits and Grace for each rank you have in this power.  Each rank
after (but not including) 5 also grants +2 Wits and Grace, and +1 to all other
stats.  Your water elemental also gets Waterborn Adept, and as many ranks in
Water Magic and Elemental Infusion as you have in this power.

In addition, as you gain ranks in Water Elemental, all of your elementals (not
just water) will gain access to certain talents: Endurance at rank 5, Iron Will
at rank 10, Mental Barrier at rank 15, Freeze at rank 20, Resist Style Mastery
at rank 25 and Great Freeze at rank 30.

Finally, your first 5 ranks in this power each give +5% health to all of your
elementals, added to that given by any of your other elemental powers, but
applied separately from Endurance.  Thus with 5 ranks in each of the four
elemental powers, all of your elementals would have their health doubled.

Your elementals can be controlled like regular pets (see 'help pets').
