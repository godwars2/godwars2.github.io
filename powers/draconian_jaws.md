This power strengthens your bite attack in Draconian Form, giving it +2 Attack,
Damage and bypass per rank, and increasing the amount of food you can digest by
10% per rank.  These bonuses are all doubled if you have Powerful Metabolism.

In addition, you no longer suffer any penalties for eating, digesting, or being
stuffed (see 'help eat'), and never get sick from consuming bad food.  When you
eat the flesh of a living creature you also recover an additional +1 health per
rank in each of Draconian Form and Draconian Jaws.

At rank 10, your bite attack performs an internal cut burst when it achieves a
critical hit, as long as no other bite burst attack has been performed (for
example if your bite has a 50% chance of performing a poison burst, then the
cut burst will only be performed if the poison burst fails to activate).

At rank 20, your bite only has to inflict damage to perform the burst attack.
