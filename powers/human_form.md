Every dragon is able to transform into human form, but this power allows you
to strengthen that form with your draconic heritage.  Each rank gives you +1%
immunity to physical damage, up to a maximum of 20% immunity at rank 20.

In addition, you are able to heal faster than a normal human.  Each rank in
this power allows you to heal an additional 0.5hp per second when healing at
full speed (see 'help healing').  Furthermore, if you are healing at full speed
your body will automatically repair minor wounds such as broken bones (the more
ranks you have in this power, the faster such wounds will be repaired).
