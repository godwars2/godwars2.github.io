This power allows you to conjure a darkblade - a shimmering blade of elemental
shadow.  You can create the blade via the 'conjure' command, and each rank in
this power gives it +2 Attack, +2 Defence, +2 Damage and +1 physical bypass.  
Each rank in Shadow Crafting grants it an additional +1 physical bypass.

The weapon can also be transformed into an ethereal blade of writhing shadow
which causes cold damage, and can shoot beams of cold energy at your opponents.

If you also have House DarkBlade, then each rank in Blade of Darkness gives you
a +10% chance of a frost burst on a critical hit, and +2 burst bypass.  Each
rank also gives +1 cold bypass, which aids both ethereal form and burst attack.

At rank 20, your darkblade inflicts dual cold damage in physical form and dual
mental damage in ethereal form.  It also gains +1 mental bypass per rank.

The darkblade will vanish if removed, but can be resummoned at any time.
