This power allows you to reforge metal weapons and armour, using your blood to
imbue them with supernatural might.  You can use this power on both magical and
non-magical items, and the process will transform the material into bloodsteel.

If you use this power on a weapon, it will gain +1 Blood Taint and +1 bypass
per rank.  When the weapon inflicts damage it will soak up blood, causing it to
throb and eventually pulsate.  When throbbing the weapon grants +1 bypass for 
each rank you have in this power.  When pulsating, it gets +2 bypass per rank.

If you use this power on armour, it will gain +1 Blood Taint, and +1% physical
or energy soak (or +2% to a specific soak type) as well as half the soak value
as auto-absorb, per rank.  If the armour already has magical soak, that soak
type will be used, otherwise heavy armour (breastplate, full helm, etc) will
gain physical soak and other types of armour will gain energy soak.

You may reforge blood tainted items at any time, specifying how much taint you 
wish it to have, up to a maximum equal to your rank in this power.  If you use
items with a taint higher than your rank, each point of difference counts as 10
points of radiation.  Non-vampires may use bloodsteel if the taint is removed.
