This power strengthens your tail while in Dragon Form or Draconian Form, and
the tail of your Dragon Mount while in Human Form, giving it +3 Attack, Damage
and bypass per rank.  If you inflict a critical hit, you will automatically
inflict an internal crush burst attack.

Note that your tail uses the Flails skill, and benefits from Whip Mastery.
