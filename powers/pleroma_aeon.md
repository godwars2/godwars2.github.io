After transcending your physical form you undertook a journey to the pleroma,
a realm of light that exists beyond the material world, where you took your
rightful place among the spiritual beings that reside there.

While in transcendent form you gain +1 energy bypass per rank, or +2 per rank
if you also have Elemental Spell Focus.

If you have a soulblade, every rank in Pleroma Aeon gives it a 5% chance of a
burst on a critical hit, and +1 bypass for the burst.  This burst is always
mental, but at rank 20 your soulblade inflicts dual damage in elemental form.

You also gain a pair of feathered wings while in transcendent form, allowing
you to travel 5000 feet, plus an additional 5000 feet per rank.  These wings
are rather fragile, and cannot be used to perform wingbash attacks.
