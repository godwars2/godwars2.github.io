This power allows you to mark yourself with mystical runes of power, using your
own blood instead of ink.  The blood instantly dries, leaving a dark stain upon
your flesh.  The runes are always drawn in matching pairs, and you can have
up to four pairs at any one time: one on your cheeks, one on the palms of your
hands, one on the soles of your feet, and one on the sides of your chest.

You steal rune knowledge by defeating the inhabitants of the shadow plane,
accessible with Path of Shadows.  Use the 'rune' command to add new runes, to
list those you know, and to list those you are currently using.  Each rune has
its own help file, although you can only view the help files for the runes you
know.  When the description of a rune refer to your 'rank', it means your rank
in Blood Runes.  If you have no ranks in this power you can still wear your
runes, but they will provide no bonuses.

Each rune has different bonuses, depending on where it's placed and which form
you are in.  You may place the same type of rune on multiple locations, or
different types on different locations, as you see fit.  If you place a new
rune over an old one, the previous rune will fade away and vanish.
