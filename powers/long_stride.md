You are able to walk, jog and run far faster than normal, and attacks made 
with your feet are particularly effective.

Your movement rate increases by +2 per rank when you are running, +1 per rank 
when you are jogging or walking (including swimming and retreating).

Your feet gain +2 Attack, Defence, Damage and crush bypass per rank, added in 
the same way as weapon bonuses.  This also applies to your mount, if any, but 
does not improve any wingbash, wingblock or pounce attacks you might have.
