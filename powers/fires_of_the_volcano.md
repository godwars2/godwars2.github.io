This power allows you to draw upon the primordial power of the volcano.  You
gain +5% heat immunity and +10% heat armour at rank 1, +4% and +8% at rank 2,
+3% and +6% at rank 3, +2% and +4% at rank 4, and +1% and +2% for every rank
after 4.  You also gain +1 heat bypass and +1 auto-absorb per rank.

While raging, each rank in this power will give you +5 Damage, +5 Power and +1
heat bypass, although this cannot exceed your rank in Draconic Rage.

If you also have Red Dragon Descendant, the above bonuses are all doubled, and
you get an additional +2 Attack/Ascendancy and +2 Damage/Power to both your
physical and magical fire breath attacks while in Dragon Form.

At rank 10, this power unlocks the Heat Wave spell sigil, with more powerful
versions available at rank 20, 30 and 40.

### Tips
The scaled armour bonuses means the first few ranks give the most benefits. Having just 4 ranks in this power gives you +14% heat immunity and +28% heat soak.
