This power allows werewolves to inspire fear in their enemies with a deafening
roar.  This roar is treated as a mental attack on everyone within range, and
if successful will (in addition to damage) fill the victim with fear, unless
their rank in their Rage power exceeds your rank in Thundering Roar.  Note that
the Berserker Rage and Tireless Rage talents each increase the effective Rage
rank of the victim by 5 for the purposes of checking whether the fear applies.

If someone is affected by the fear, they will suffer -5 Attack and Defence for
every rank you have in this power, lasting for 10 seconds, plus 2 seconds per
rank.  They will also be unable to activate any rage-based powers.

If someone is already in a Rage when struck by this power, they also add their
Extended Rage to their effective Rage rank for resisting the fear effect of
your Thundering Roar.  If you still beat them, their rage is stripped away.

The roar technique gets natural bypass at rank 10, upgraded at ranks 20 and 30.
