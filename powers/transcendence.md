This power allows you to transcend your physical body, becoming a being of pure
energy.  While in this form you are completely immune to poison damage, and get
30% immunity vs physical damage and 20% immunity vs other damage types, +1% per
rank for your first 20 ranks in this power.  Each rank in this power also gives
you +1 mental bypass (or +2 if you also have Psychic Mastery), as well as +4%
natural armour vs physical damage and +2% natural armour vs other damage types.

You also get +1 bypass and +2% armour vs heat, shock, physical, cold and mental
damage per rank in Fire Magic, Air Magic, Earth Magic, Water Magic and Mind
Magic respectively.  However this cannot exceed your rank in Transcendence.

In addition, your speed cap is increased by 5, your movement rate is greatly
increased, and each rank in this power gives a +1 bonus to Attack, Ascendancy,
Defence, Protection, Damage, Power, Resistance and Speed.

While in this form you cannot use any equipment, except for ethereal items, and
weapons summoned through magic or with the Conjure Soulblade power.
