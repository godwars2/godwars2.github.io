This power allows you to draw upon the primordial power of the storm.  You
gain +5% shock immunity and +10% shock armour at rank 1, +4% and +8% at rank 2,
+3% and +6% at rank 3, +2% and +4% at rank 4, and +1% and +2% for every rank
after 4.  You also gain +1 shock bypass and +1 auto-absorb per rank.

While raging, each rank in this power will give +1 Speed and +1 shock bypass,
although this cannot exceed your rank in Draconic Rage.

If you also have Blue Dragon Descendant, the above bonuses are all doubled, and
you get an additional +2 Attack/Ascendancy and +2 Damage/Power to both your
physical and magical lightning breath attacks while in Dragon Form.

At rank 10, this power unlocks the Shock Wave spell sigil, with more powerful
versions available at rank 20, 30 and 40.
