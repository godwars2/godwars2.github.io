This power allows you to summon a fire elemental.  The elemental has 5 in each
stat, plus 1 Brawn and Tenacity for each rank you have in this power.  Each
rank after (but not including) 5 grants +2 Brawn and Tenacity, and +1 to all
other stats.  Your fire elemental also gets Flameborn Adept, and as many ranks
in Fire Magic and Elemental Infusion as you have in this power.

In addition, as you gain ranks in Fire Elemental, all of your elementals (not
just fire) will gain access to certain talents: Ambidextrous at rank 5, Attack
Style Mastery at rank 10, Damage Style Mastery at rank 15, Burn at rank 20,
Speed Style Mastery at rank 25 and Great Burn at rank 30.

Finally, your first 5 ranks in this power each give +5% health to all of your
elementals, added to that given by any of your other elemental powers, but
applied separately from Endurance.  Thus with 5 ranks in each of the four
elemental powers, all of your elementals would have their health doubled.

Your elementals can be controlled like regular pets (see 'help pets').
