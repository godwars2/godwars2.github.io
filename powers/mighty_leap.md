You are able to leap great distances via the 'ht' (head travel) command, and 
your feet gain a pounce attack via the 'fp' command.

Each rank increases the range of your travel technique by 5000 feet.

Your pounce gains +2 Attack, Defence, Damage and crush bypass per rank, added
in the same way as weapon bonuses.  If you have Long Stride, its bonuses do 
not apply to your pounce attack.

The range of your pounce increases by 100 feet at ranks 20, 30 and 40.  You 
will still pounce at 100 feet per second, but will remain in the air longer.
