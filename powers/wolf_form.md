This power allows you to take on the form of a wolf, while still retaining your
supernatural gifts.  While in Wolf Form you gain +1 Speed, +2 Damage and +2
Resistance for each rank you have in this power, applied before percentage
modifiers.  Each rank also gives you +1% natural armour vs all damage types.

In addition, your maximum Speed (for gaining AP) is increased by 5, and your
movement rate is increased by 2 for walking and 5 for running, with every 5
ranks increasing your running speed by an additional +1.  You also gain 30%
immunity to physical damage, 20% immunity to cold, shock and poison damage,
and 10% immunity to heat and mental damage.  While shapechanged, you have a
separate inventory and equipment set, and can only wear a collar or necklace.
