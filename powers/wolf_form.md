This power allows you to take on the form of a wolf, while still retaining your
supernatural gifts.  While in Wolf Form you gain +1 Speed, +2 Damage and +2
Resistance for each rank you have in this power, applied before percentage
modifiers.  Each rank also gives you +1% natural armour vs all damage types.

In addition, your maximum Speed (for gaining AP) is increased by 5, and your
movement rate is increased by 2 for walking and 5 for running, with every 5
ranks increasing your running speed by an additional +1.  You also gain 30%
immunity to physical damage, 20% immunity to cold, shock and poison damage,
and 10% immunity to heat and mental damage.  While shapechanged, you have a
separate inventory and equipment set, and can only wear a collar or necklace.

### Equipment

Wolf Form can only wear a collar, spiked collar or fang necklace.

### Combat tables

The wolf form claw table has 3 basic techniques to hit high, middle and low, does not have any defence, and cannot be used for magic. The head table only has bite by default, but you are able to use Thundering Roar, various Psionics spells, and any other head techniques from powers and talents. You can stalk (using walking speed), run, circle, pounce and swim with your feet, or fly if you have the appropriate talents.

### Tips

- Since Wolf Form can only wear one piece of equipment, players usually “top up” their collars using Enchantment to reach their maximum radiation.
- House NightWing or Dragon Blooded gives you wings to travel and fly with, to make up for the relatively low movement speed of Wolf Form.
