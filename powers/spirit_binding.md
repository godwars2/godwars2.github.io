This power allows you to bind and unbind spirits into your weapons (and fang
bracelets, if you also have Fang Forging).  The spirits give the following:

```
Phoenix   : Fire burst/bypass for weapons.  +1 heat bypass for bracelets.
Stormcrow : Shock burst/bypass for weapons.  +1 shock bypass for bracelets.
SnowyOwl  : Frost burst/bypass for weapons.  +1 cold bypass for bracelets.
Viper     : +1 Speed for weapons.  +2 unarmed Attack/Damage for bracelets.
Crane     : +4 Defence for weapons.  +1 unarmed bypass for bracelets.
Crab      : +1 bypass for weapons.  +1 cut bypass for bracelets.
Mongoose  : +4 Attack for weapons.  +1 stab bypass for bracelets.
Bull      : +2 Damage for weapons.  +1 crush bypass for bracelets.
Shark     : +1 bypass for bite attacks/bursts (necklaces only).
```

The 'burst/bypass' is a +5% chance of causing an burst attack on a critical hit
and +1 bypass for the burst.  A weapon can only have one type of burst bonus.

You may bind as many spirits into an item as you have ranks in this power, plus
one for each point of Moon Taint or spiritual energy it has.  You can wear up
to three spirits (divided among all your items) per rank without penalty, but
each spirit beyond that is treated as 15 points of radiation.
