Your jaws have become a potent weapon, and you are able to bite chunks of flesh
from your opponents during combat via the 'hb' (head bite) command.

Your bite gains +2 Attack, Damage and bypass per rank, added in the same way as
weapon bonuses.  In addition, your bite has a 5% chance per rank of inflicting
an internal cut burst on a critical hit.
