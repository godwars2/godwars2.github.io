You are able to scoop up and hurl rocks and other objects via the grab command,
eg 'rg' for a right grab and throw, or 'lg' for a left grab and throw.

Your throw gains +25 range and +2 Attack, Damage and bypass per rank, added in
the same way as weapon bonuses.  In addition, if you perform a defence command
('ld' or 'rd') before the grab, your throw has a 1% chance per rank of causing
knockback on a critical hit.

This technique gets natural bypass at rank 20, upgraded at ranks 30 and 40.
