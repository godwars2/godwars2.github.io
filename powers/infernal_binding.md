This power lets you bind and unbind imps into your weapons.  You may only bind 
imps into weapons which have been tainted from Infernal Forging, and the bonus 
it gives depends upon the type of imp you bind into the weapon:

- Smoke   : +4 Attack, +5% chance of fire burst on critical, +1 burst bypass.
- Flame   : +4 Defence, +5% chance of fire burst on critical, +1 burst bypass.
- Sulphur : +2 Damage, +5% chance of fire burst on critical, +1 burst bypass.
- Bearded : +1 Speed, +5% chance of fire burst on critical, +1 burst bypass.
- Frost   : +5% chance of frost burst on critical, +1 burst bypass.
- Spark   : +5% chance of shock burst on critical, +1 burst bypass.
- Horned  : +4 Attack and +1 bypass (depending on the weapon type).
- Spiked  : +4 Defence and +1 bypass (depending on the weapon type).
- Bladed  : +2 Damage and +1 bypass (depending on the weapon type).
- Barbed  : +1 Speed and +1 bypass (depending on the weapon type).
- Rock    : +2% physical soak (may also be bound into pieces of heavy armour).
- Chaos   : Enchants any non-magical demonsteel item (costs 500 soul points).

You may have as many imps bound into each weapon as you have ranks in Infernal
Binding, although not all types of imp can be placed into all weapons.  If a 
weapon has more imps than you have ranks, each extra imp gives 25 radiation.
