This power allows you to draw upon the legacy of your supernatural blood.  All
vampires possess fangs, but this power allows your jaw to open far further than
normal, while strengthening your fangs to give a powerful bite attack.  Each
rank in this power gives +2 Attack, +2 Damage and +1 bypass to your bite attack
technique (visible in the head combat table), and allows you to recover between
1 and your rank points of mana (rank+5 if you have Dark Lineage).  The amount
of mana you recover is doubled on a critical hit.  Bat Form bite is unaffected.

You may also use the 'legacy' command to focus on one of the following:

Puissance : Gain +10 Damage per rank.
Swiftness : Gain +10 Attack, +10 Defence and +1 movement rate per rank.
Fortitude : Gain +15 Resistance per rank.
Mesmerise : Your opponent is unable to change their target to another creature.

You may only use one of the above bonuses at a time, and the duration is 15
seconds per rank (except for Mesmerise, which lasts 5 seconds per rank).  After
using Blood Legacy, you must wait 30 seconds before you can use it again.
