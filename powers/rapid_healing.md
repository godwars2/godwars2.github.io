Titans are godlike beings, possessing incredible regenerative abillities, with
wounds closing and lost limbs regrowing in a matter of minutes or even seconds.

You heal an extra 0.5hp per second when healing at full speed, as described in 
'help healing'.  If you've suffered a special wound (see 'help wounds', half of
your ranks (rounded up) will be temporarily diverted into repairing the wound.
