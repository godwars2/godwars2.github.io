You are able to clap your hands together with thunderous force using the 'pp' 
hand technique (eg 'rp' then 'rp' for a right handed attack).  This attack will
inflict mental damage.

Your clap gains +5 range and +2 Attack, Damage and bypass per rank, added in
the same way as weapon bonuses.  You attack every standing creature in range, 
and have a 5% chance per rank of knocking them over on a critical hit.

This technique gets natural bypass at rank 20, upgraded at ranks 30 and 40.
