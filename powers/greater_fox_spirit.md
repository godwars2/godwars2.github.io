This power indicates that you have allied yourself with a greater fox spirit.
You gain +5 feet Defence, +1 movement rate and +1 Speed per rank, although the
Speed bonus cannot exceed your rank in Feral Senses.

If you have Assassin Training, your rank in this power adds to the invisibility
level of your stealth, and the duration increases by 10 seconds per rank.

At rank 10, your stealth invisibility (if any) uses your naked Discipline to
determine its initial duration, rather than your base Discipline.

At rank 20, you are able to use your Protection against physical burst attacks
instead of having a Defence of 1.  The burst will still always hit, but it will
do less average damage and have a lower chance of causing a critical hit.

At rank 30, if you have Desert Wolfkin, Arctic Wolfkin, Spirit Wolfkin or Swamp
Wolfkin, you can use your Protection against heat, cold, shock or poison bursts
respectively.  If you have Psychic Wall or Mental Barrier, you are also able to
use your Protection against mental bursts.

Note that you may still call the aid of a Lesser Totem Spirit as usual.
