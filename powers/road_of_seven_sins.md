This power allows you to draw upon the strength of sins to benefit yourself and
hinder your opponents.  Type 'sin \<name>' to activate, where the sin is one of:

- Lust     : Your opponent is unable to change their target to another creature.
- Gluttony : Health bonus from eating, faster regeneration while stomach is full.
- Greed    : Rank% chance of monsters you kill dropping a 2nd piece of equipment.
- Sloth    : Reduces your target's movement rate and Speed by 1 each per rank.
- Wrath    : Gain +5 Attack and Damage per rank, and counts as a form of rage.
- Envy     : Gain +2 Attack and Defence per rank, plus opponent's age difference.
- Pride    : Gain +5 bonus to Ascendancy, Protection and Power per rank.

Lust and Sloth are non-physical attacks using Ascendancy vs Protection, lasting
5 seconds per rank if successful.  Wrath has the same duration as your rage, or
30 seconds if you are not raging.  The other sins all last 15 seconds per rank.

You must be targeting a creature in order to use Lust, Sloth or Envy.  After 
performing a sin, you require 30 seconds of penance before you can sin again.

If you have Living Nightmare, Wrath no longer counts as a rage.  Furthermore, 
the duration of your sins increases by 5 seconds per rank, while the duration 
of your penance is reduced by 1 second per 5 ranks.
