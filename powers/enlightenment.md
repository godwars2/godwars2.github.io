You have attained true enlightenment, and are able to unlock your primordial
mental state via the 'enlightenment' command, which has five options: Focus
(+20 Attack and +10 Damage), Wisdom (+20 Ascendancy and +10 Power), Acumen (+20
Defence and +20 Protection), Haste (+4 Speed and +2 movement rate) and Resolve
(+15 Resistance and +1% health).  These bonuses are per rank.

If you have Burn, Freeze, Shock or Psionics, you gain +1 heat, cold, shock or
mental bypass per rank, increased to +2 per rank if you have Elemental Spell
Focus, or if you have Great Burn, Great Freeze, Great Shock or Psychic Mastery.

You may change the option at will for the duration of your enlightenment, which
is 30 seconds, plus 3 seconds per rank.  Each rank in Mind Magic will increase
the duration by an additional 2 seconds, and also increase your speed cap by 1.

Enlightenment is affected by fear as if it were a rage power, with Mind Magic
replacing Extended Rage for the purposes of resisting the fear.  Berserker Rage
and Tireless Rage do not provide any bonuses, as this is not actually a rage.

After using this power, you will be at -10 Defence, -10 Protection and -5 Speed
for 30 seconds.  Mind Over Matter negates these penalties, and Iron Will lowers
the duration to 20 seconds.  These two talents each increase the duration of
your enlightenment by 10 seconds, give +2 speed cap, and +5 to resist fear.
