This power allows the Demon to feed upon the hate and anger of humanity, and
focus it into a violent rage that improves their combat prowess.  By utilising
this power, you gain a +5 bonus to Attack and Defence, +10 Damage and +1 Speed
for each rank you have in this power.  The demonic rage lasts 30 seconds, and
also negates all pain penalties while active.

Unfortunately this power will also leave the demon slightly weakened for a 
while afterwards, but in the heat of battle it is often considered worth the 
cost.  For 30 seconds after the rage has finished, you will suffer a penalty of
-10 to your Attack, Defence and Damage, and -5 to your Speed.

If you also have the Berserker Rage talent, then the bonuses from that will be 
applied at the same time as your Demonic Rage, although this power will be used
to determine the duration.  If you have the Tireless Rage talent, then it will
also negate the exhaustion penalties for this power.
