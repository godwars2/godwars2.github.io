This power allows you to summon an animal familiar.  The familiar is weak in
combat, but when perched on your shoulder it provides certain benefits:

Raven: Uses its Feral Senses to warn you about deaths and power surges.  It has
a number of ranks in Feral Senses equal to your rank in this power.

Magpie: Gives a chance of finding a second magical item each time you kill a
mob.  The percentage chance of a second drop equals your rank in this power.

Viper: Gives you a percentage bonus to health equal to your rank in this power.

See 'help pets' to learn how you can control your familiar.  You may only have
one familiar at a time, but may dismiss one and summon another at will.
