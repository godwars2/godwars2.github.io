This power allows you to assume a hybrid form - half human, half dragon.  In
this form you get 10% immunity to all forms of damage, and your movement rate
is increased by 2 when walking and 5 when jogging or running.  Your Draconian
Form also gains +1% immunity to physical damage per rank, up to a maximum of
20% immunity at rank 20.  Your claws in this form gain +1 Attack, Damage and
bypass per rank, doubled to +2 per rank if you also have Iron Talons.

By travelling to the Dragon Realm and slaying its inhabitants, you will unlock
infusions for customising your form.  Your rank in this power determines your
bonuses for nine of these infusions (face, horns, eyes, mouth, scales, hide,
pattern, stomach and wings).  To apply your infusions, type 'infuse'.

Three of your infusions are scales, hide and pattern.  The scales and hide each
give +2% physical armour per rank, while pattern gives +1% physical armour per
rank, but each of these bonuses can be replaced using infusions.  If scales and
hide have the same infusion, your scales will be described as having a pure
colour, and you will not benefit from any pattern bonus regardless of infusion.

At rank 10, you gain the ability to draw spell sigils with your claws, although
the actual spells are unlocked by other powers (eg Eye of the Storm rank 10+).
