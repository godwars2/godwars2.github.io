This power allows you to partially transform yourself into an earth elemental.
Physically you still appear human, although your skin turns a stony grey and
your eyes glimmer like opals.  While in this hybrid form you gain 30% immunity
to physical and poison damage, and 5% immunity to all other forms of damage.
You may still use equipment and weapons as normal, and gain +1 Resistance, +1
Damage and +4 Health for every rank you have in this power.  Each of your first
20 ranks also give +1% immunity to all damage types.
