This power allows you to summon an air elemental.  The elemental has 5 in each
stat, plus 1 Discipline and Aura for each rank you have in this power.  Each
rank after (but not including) 5 grants +2 Discipline and Aura, and +1 to all
other stats.  Your elemental also gets Windborn Adept, and as many ranks in Air
Magic and Elemental Infusion as you have in this power.

In addition, as you gain ranks in Air Elemental, all of your elementals (not
just air) will gain access to certain talents: Sure Footed at rank 5, Evasion
at rank 10, Instinctive Dodge at rank 15, Shock at rank 20, Blind Fighting at
rank 25 and Great Shock at rank 30.

Finally, your first 5 ranks in this power each give +5% health to all of your
elementals, added to that given by any of your other elemental powers, but
applied separately from Endurance.  Thus with 5 ranks in each of the four
elemental powers, all of your elementals would have their health doubled.

Your elementals can be controlled like regular pets (see 'help pets').
