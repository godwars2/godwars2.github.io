You have learned to strengthen your elemental form, drawing upon and combining
the power of all four elements.  Whichever elemental form you use, you gain all
the ranked bonuses of all four elemental form powers, except for immunities.

The natural immunity also spills over between your forms.  Your first 20 ranks
in Form of Fire each give +1% heat immunity, while Form of Water does the same
for cold, Form of Air for shock and Form of Earth for mental immunity.

You gain +1 bypass for physical, heat, cold and shock damage for each rank in
Form of Earth, Form of Fire, Form of Water and Form of Air respectively.  This
bonus is doubled while you are in the appropriate elemental form.

If your rank in Immanence is lower than the appropriate elemental form power,
then your rank in Immanence will be used to determine the relevant bonuses.

At rank 5, you no longer suffer penalties while shapechanging.  At rank 10,
you gain the ability to shift directly between forms, rather than having to
change back to human form first.  At rank 15 you are able to shapechange in 4
seconds rather than 5, while at rank 20 you can shapechange in only 3 seconds.
