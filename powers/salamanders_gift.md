All Supernaturalis are capable of healing far more rapidly than a mortal, but
some possess the ability to regenerate at a truly phenomenal speed.  Each rank
in this power allows you to heal an additional 0.5hp per second when healing at
full speed (see 'help healing').  Furthermore, if you are healing at full speed
your body will automatically repair minor wounds such as broken bones (the more
ranks you have in this power, the faster such wounds will be repaired).

This power also unlocks the regenerate head command, if you didn't already have
it, and at rank 5 allows you to use the enhanced version by typing 'hr+'.  At
rank 10 you gain access to a use command on severed hands, which allows you
to reattach them while holding them.  At rank 15 you gain a regrow command on
your stumps, which allows you to regrow new hands.  At rank 20 the cost of
regrowing a new hand goes down by 50AP, and the delay is reduced by 1 second.
