This power allows you to summon a swarm of rats to attack your enemies.  The
swarm's skills and styles improve in the same way as a PC, and if killed it may
be resummoned back at your home plane without any loss of progress.  The rats
will follow simple verbal commands such as 'kill', 'north', 'follow', 'leave'
and 'style' (see 'help pets').  To summon your swarm, type 'summon vermin'.

Your vermin swarm has a base of 6 Brawn, 10 Grace, 6 Mettle, 10 Size, 10 Wits,
6 Tenacity, 1 Discipline and 1 Aura.  Each rank gives the swarm an additional
+1 Brawn, Grace, Mettle, Size and Wits.  The vermin have a rank in Bat Form
equal to your rank in Summon Vermin, but don't get the movement rate as rats.

At rank 20, you will summon a cloud of bats instead of a swarm of rats.  If you
also have rank 20 in Bat Form, you will be able to merge with the bats, giving
you a number of Bat Focus (BF) points equal to your total ranks in Bat Form,
Shapechanging, Summon Vermin and Beast Master, and unlocking 3 new techniques
to spend them on; knockover (knockback on hit), infect (gives more bypass and
inflicts a wasting disease on a critical hit) and regenerate (heals damage).
