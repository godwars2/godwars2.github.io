This power allows you to strengthen your dragonscale armour, infusing it with
draconic energy.  You may apply various different types of bonus, although at
least half of the enhancements on each item must be armour bonuses.

Use the 'craft' command to add bonuses to dragonscale, as well as to view which
bonuses are available.  The cost of adding armour bonuses depends upon the type
of dragonscale and the number of locations the item covers, but the other bonus
types have fixed costs.  You can wear 100 points of dragonscale enhancement per
rank without penalty, with each point beyond that counting as radiation.
