This power allows you to travel back and forth between the shadow plane and
the material plane via the 'path' command.  It takes 30 seconds to shift
between planes, and engaging in combat will disrupt your attempt.

Because of your close association with the shadow plane, you gain +1% immunity,
+2% armour and +1 auto-absorb per rank against cold damage.  In addition, you
gain +1 bypass per rank for all cold-based attacks you make.

If you also have the House ShadowSworn talent, the above bonuses are doubled,
and each rank in this power will also give you +10 range, +2 Ascendancy and +1
Power to each of the spells granted by House ShadowSworn, as well as increase
their duration and stat bonuses by the equivalent of 5 ranks.

If you have access to magic, this power will give you the Shadowbolt and Summon
Shadow spells.  At rank 8 you also get Resist Energy (cold).  At rank 10 you
get Shadow Flux and a second Shadowbolt.  At rank 15 you get Black Lightning.
At rank 20 you get Drain Lifeforce and Foul Rot.  At rank 25 you get Tenebrous
Chains.
