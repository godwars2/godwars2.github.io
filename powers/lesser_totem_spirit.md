This power allows you to call upon the aid of various lesser totem spirits.  To
activate the power, type 'totem <spirit>', where the spirit is one of:

Owl: An owl spirit will carry you to your targeted destination.  It has a
maximum range of 5000 feet per rank, but can't be called while you're fighting.

Badger: A badger spirit infuses your body, giving +5 Ascendancy, Protection and
Power per rank for 15 seconds per rank.  To dismiss it, type 'totem off'.

Boar: A boar spirit infuses your body, giving +5 Damage, +1% health and +1%
armour vs all damage per rank.  You can only call this spirit while in a rage.

Antelope: An antelope spirit infuses your body, giving +5 Attack, +5 Defence
and +1 running speed for 30 seconds per rank.  To dismiss it, type 'totem off'.

You must wait 30 seconds between calling spirits (except for the owl spirit).
