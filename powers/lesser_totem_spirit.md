This power allows you to call upon the aid of various lesser totem spirits.  To
activate the power, type `totem <spirit>`, where the spirit is one of:

Spirit | Bonus (per rank) | Duration | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Owl | +5000 feet range (1) | NA | Can't be called with a fight timer
Badger | +5 Ascendancy, Protection and Power | 15 seconds per rank | Can be dismissed with `totem off`
Boar | +5 Damage, +1% health and +1% armour vs all damage | Lasts the duration of your rage | Can only call this spirit while in a rage<br />Can't be dismissed
Antelope | +5 Attack, +5 Defence and +1 running speed | 30 seconds per rank | Can be dismissed with `totem off`

You must wait 30 seconds between calling spirits (except for the owl spirit).

### Tips

- One rank in this power gives you a 5000 feet travel (totem owl), which is useful for finding map nodes.
- You can call the owl spirit even if you have another spirit active.
- It's useful to have 100% balance from equipment or a cave lion shin tattoo when using the owl spirit as it drops you from a height at your target destination instead of landing you gently.

1) Calls an owl spirit to carry you to your target destination, similar to the head travel tech with wings.
