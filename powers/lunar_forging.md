This power allows you to weave strands of moonlight into metal weapons and
armour, transforming them into an extremely light and strong material called
moonsilver.  You can use this power on both magical and non-magical items.

If you use this power on a weapon, it will gain +1 Moon Taint and +1 bypass
per rank.  The type of bypass depends on the weapon and any existing bonuses.

If you use this power on armour, it will gain +1 Moon Taint, and +1% physical
or energy soak (or +2% to a specific soak type) as well as half the soak value
as auto-absorb, per rank.  If the armour already has magical soak, that soak
type will be used, otherwise it will gain physical soak.  Each piece of heavy
armour you forge also gains +5 Health per point of taint.

You may reforge moonsilver items at any time, specifying how much taint you
wish them to have, up to a maximum equal to twice your rank in this power.  If
you use items with a taint higher than your rank, each point of difference
counts as 10 points of radiation.  The taint cannot be completely removed.
