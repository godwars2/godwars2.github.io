This power allows you to summon an earth elemental.  The elemental has 5 in
each stat, plus 1 Mettle and Size for each rank you have in this power.  Each
rank after (but not including) 5 grants +2 Mettle and Size, and +1 to all other
stats.  Your earth elemental also gets Earthborn Adept, and as many ranks in
Earth Magic and Elemental Infusion as you have in this power.

In addition, as you gain ranks in Earth Elemental, all of your elementals (not
just earth) will gain access to certain talents: Toughness at rank 5, Iron
Fists at rank 10, Smash at rank 15 and Great Smash at rank 20.

Finally, your first 5 ranks in this power each give +5% health to all of your
elementals, added to that given by any of your other elemental powers, but
applied separately from Endurance.  Thus with 5 ranks in each of the four
elemental powers, all of your elementals would have their health doubled.

Your elementals can be controlled like regular pets (see 'help pets').
