This power allows you to form ritualistic scars on your body, drawing upon the 
infernal powers to grant you unholy strength.  These scars will only aid you 
while in human form; your Demon Form benefits from these powers more directly.

You may have up to five separate scars at any one time: one on your forehead, 
one on your chest, one on your stomach, a matching pair on your wrists and a 
matching pair on your ankles.  Note that a matching pair counts as one.

You steal scar knowledge by defeating the inhabitants of hell, using the same
knowledges that allow you to warp your Demon Form.  Use the 'scar' command to 
add new scars or view your current ones.  Each knowledge has its own help file, 
although you can only view those you know.  When the description of a scar help
file refers to your 'rank', it means your rank in Ritual Scarring.  If you have
no ranks in this power, your scars will provide no bonuses.

Each scar has different bonuses, depending on where it's placed.  You may place
the same type of scar on multiple locations, or different types on different 
locations.  If a scar provides the same bonus for both chest and stomach you 
can choose to double that bonus by applying it to both locations.  If you place
a new scar over an old one, the previous scar will fade away and vanish.
