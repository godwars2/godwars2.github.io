This power strengthens all animals you summon, as long as you also have at
least 10 ranks in the appropriate summoning power.

If you summon a wolf, it will gain a number of ranks in Feral Senses and Claws
of the Wolf equal to your rank in this power, and half that in Regeneration.  
Your wolf also gains new talents based on your rank: Ambidextrous at rank 1,
Razor Claws at rank 5, Cleave at rank 10, Powerful Metabolism at rank 15, Great
Cleave at rank 20, Smash at rank 30 and Great Smash at rank 40.

If you summon a swarm of vermin, your first 10 ranks in this power will each
give the swarm +10% health, applied directly after (but separately from) the
Endurance talent that all swarms have.  Every rank beyond 10 gives +1 Brawn,
Grace, Mettle, Size and Wits.  The swarm gets a rank in Shapechanging equal to
your rank in Beast Master, as well as the following talents: Evasion at rank 5,
Cleave at rank 10, House NightWing at rank 20 (but only if you also have it,
and they are bats), Venom at rank 30 and Great Cleave at rank 40.
