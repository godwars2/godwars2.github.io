This power taints your talons with infernal energy, giving them +1 Attack, +2 
Damage and +2 bypass per rank, added in the same way as weapon bonuses.  These
bonuses apply to talons used in human form as well as by the Demon Form power.

If you use a warp on your arms to change your hands into something else (such 
as pincers) they will also gain the above bonuses, although the bypass bonus 
will only apply to physical attacks.
