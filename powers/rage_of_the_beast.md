The gift of vampirism enhances not just the physical and mental attributes, but
also the emotional ones.  By utilising this power, you are able to focus your
inner rage into a concentrated fury, gaining a +5 bonus to Attack, Defence,
Damage and Speed for each rank you have in this power.  The rage lasts for 30
seconds, and also negates all pain penalties while active.

Unfortunately this power will also leave the vampire slightly weakened for a
while afterwards, but in the heat of battle it is often considered worth the
cost.  For 30 seconds after the rage has finished, you will suffer a penalty of
-10 to your Attack, Defence and Damage, and -5 to your Speed.

If you also have the Berserker Rage talent, then the bonuses from that will be
applied at the same time as your Rage of the Beast, although this power will be
used to determine the duration.  If you have the Tireless Rage talent, then it
will also negate the exhaustion penalties for this power.
