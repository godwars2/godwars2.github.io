This power allows the vampire to transform into a cloud of bats.  While in Bat
Form you become immune to mental attacks that specifically target your heart or
mind, and gain 95% immunity to all other forms of mental damage.  You also gain
50% immunity to crush damage, 53% to cut damage and 55% to stab damage.

While in Bat Form you will have a different inventory set, and be unable to use
equipment.  Your combat tables will all change to cloud tables, and your feet
will provide you with a long-ranged travel technique.  Your movement rate will
also be increased to 66 feet per second (i.e., the fastest possible).

As your Bat Form improves, so does the size and power of your cloud.  Each rank
gives you +1 Size and +5000 feet travel range, and the first 20 ranks also give
you +1% immunity to all forms of damage except mental (so that at rank 20 you
will have 75% immunity to stab damage, 95% immunity to mental, 73% immunity to
cut, 70% immunity to crush and 20% immunity to all other forms of damage).

At rank 20, you unlock the 'merge' and 'split' commands.  These require you to
also have rank 20 in Summon Vermin (see 'help Summon Vermin' for more details).
