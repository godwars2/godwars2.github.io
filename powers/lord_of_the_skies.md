This power strengthens your wings while in Dragon Form or Draconian Form, and
the wings of your Dragon Mount while in Human Form, increasing your range of
travel by 5000 feet per rank.

Your wings (or those of your Dragon Mount) also become more effective weapons,
gaining +2 bypass, +2 Attack and +1 Damage per rank when making a wingbash
attack, and +3 Defence per rank when performing a wingblock defence.

While in Dragon Form or riding a Dragon Mount, you are able to launch yourself
into the air and remain airborne.  Every 10 seconds you spend in the air will
increase your Flight Exhaustion by 1, up to a maximum of 10 after 100 seconds,
while every 10 seconds spent on the ground will decrease it by 1.  Your Flight
Exhaustion is applied as a penalty to your Speed Cap, although every rank in
this power will reduce that penalty by 1 (meaning no more penalty at rank 10).

At rank 5, you gain an airborne swoop attack while using Dragon Form or riding
your Dragon Mount.  At rank 10, you remain at full flying speed after a swoop.
This swoop attack gets +2 bypass, +2 Attack and +1 Damage per rank.  Every rank
also increases your flying movement rate in Dragon Form by +1 feet per second.
