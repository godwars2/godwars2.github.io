This power allows the dragon to focus its mighty rage, improving its prowess in
combat.  While utilising this power, you gain +5 Attack, +5 Defence, +5 Damage,
+1 Speed and +1% Health per rank.  You gain further bonuses from Chill of the
Tundra, Eye of the Storm, Fires of the Volcano, Fumes of the Pit and Winds of
the Mind, as described in their respective help files.  Your Draconic Rage will
last 30 seconds, and negates all pain penalties while active (see 'help pain').

Unfortunately this power will also leave the dragon slightly weakened for a
while afterwards.  For 30 seconds after the rage has finished, you will suffer
a penalty of -10 to your Attack, Defence and Damage, and -5 to your Speed.

If you also have the Berserker Rage talent, then the bonuses from that will be
applied at the same time as your Draconic Rage, although this power will be
used to determine the duration.  If you have the Tireless Rage talent, then it
will also negate the exhaustion penalties for this power.
