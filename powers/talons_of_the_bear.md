This power allows the werewolf to supernaturally strengthen his talons, both in
human and wolfman form, granting them +2 Attack and Defence, +1 Damage and +1
bypass, per rank, added in the same way as weapon bonuses.  These bonuses also
apply to the talons used by the Wolf Form power, although those claws have no
defensive techniques and therefore cannot benefit from the Defence bonus.

If you also have the Iron Talons talent, then each rank in Talons of the Bear
will give your claws an additional +1 bypass while in wolf form.
