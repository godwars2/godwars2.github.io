This power allows you to take on your true demon form.  In this form you gain
10% immunity to all forms of damage, and your movement rate is increased by 2
when walking and 5 when jogging or running.  Your default hands locations will
be set to the claws combat table, and your head and feet will be changed to
demonform-specific combat tables.  Each rank also grants your demon form +1
Damage, Power and Resistance.  To assume this form, type 'demonform'.

This form also has cloven hooves, which gain +25% physical immunity.  Each rank
in this power also gives your feet +4% armour vs physical damage, +2% vs heat, 
cold and shock, and +1% vs poison damage, as well as +1 physical auto-absorb 
and half that vs other damage types (see 'help armour').  If your warps prevent
you wearing equipment below the waist, this protection will also apply to your 
groin and legs.  If you are using an unarmoured warp or talent (such as Crystal
Devil skin, or Oni Spawn), the protection it provides will replace this bonus.

If you travel to hell from the nexus (using Pathway to Hell), each mob you kill
there will unlock a different warp, allowing you to customise your demon form.
To view or apply your available warps, type 'warp'.  If a warp gives a ranked 
bonus without specifying a power, it's referring to your rank in Demon Form.
