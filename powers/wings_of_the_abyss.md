This power strengthens your wings in Demon Form, increasing their range of 
travel by 5000 feet per rank.  It also increases the combat effectiveness of 
your wings, giving them +2 bypass, +2 Attack and +1 Damage per rank when making
a wingbash attack, and +3 Defence per rank when performing a wingblock defence.

You also gain a pair of batlike wings while in human form.  These gain the 
same bonuses described above, but are not affected by Demon Form warps and are 
not strong enough to wear wing-spikes.
