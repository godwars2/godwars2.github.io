This power allows you to partially transform yourself into a fire elemental.
Physically you still appear human, although your eyes glow like white-hot coals
and your hair becomes a mane of writhing flames.  While in this hybrid form you
gain 10% immunity to all forms of physical damage and 55% immunity to fire and
poison damage.  You may still use equipment and weapons as normal, as long as
the items are able to withstand high temperatures (eg iron and steel are fine,
while wood and cloth are not).  Each rank you have in this power gives +4
Ascendancy and +1 Power.  Each of your first 20 ranks also give +2% physical
immunity and +1% heat/poison immunity.
