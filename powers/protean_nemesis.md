This power allows you to adapt to the weaknesses of your opponent, giving you
+2% bypass per rank for one physical damage type (cut, stab or crush), and +1% 
bypass per rank for one energy damage type (heat, cold or shock).  To activate 
this power type 'nemesis' while targeting your opponent.  Your next physical 
attack will determine which type of physical bypass you gain, while your next 
energy attack will determine which type of energy bypass you gain, based on the
weaknesses of your opponent.  This bypass only applies against your nemesis.

You may type 'nemesis clear' to clear your nemesis and remove the bypass bonus,
although it will take 30 seconds before you can activate it again (reduced to 
25 seconds at rank 10, 20 seconds at rank 20 and 15 seconds at rank 30).  If 
you kill your nemesis, the bypass bonus is automatically removed.

You also gain +4% natural armour per rank vs one physical damage type, and +2% 
natural armour per rank vs one energy damage type.  After taking and applying 
damage, the appropriate physical or energy armour bonus will change to the type
of damage you just received.  This natural armour is always active, covers all 
locations, updates each time you take damage and applies against all attackers.
You may lock the armour to its current damage types by typing 'nemesis lock'.
