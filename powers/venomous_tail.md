This power causes you to grow a giant scorpion tail while in Demon Form, 
allowing you to make deadly stinger attacks via the 'ts' (tail sting) command.
Each rank in this power grants +5 Attack to the sting attack, and if the blow 
connects you will automatically inject venom into your opponent and then rip 
the stinger back out (these last two attacks always hit, but only if the first 
attack was successful, and not against swarm creatures).  Each rank in this 
power also grants +5 Damage to the venom attack.

All three parts of your tail attack gain +1 bypass per rank.  Both Fiend Spawn 
and Venom each increase this bonus by a further +1 bypass per rank.

If you have a Warbeast, it will also have this tail while you're riding it.
