This power allows the demon to summon a fearsome warbeast to serve as a mount,
with your rank representing your skill at handling it.  Each rank grants +2 to
bypass, Attack and Defence, and +1 to Damage, applied to your feet techniques 
while riding a warbeast in the same way as weapon bonuses are applied to hands.
In addition, the range of your warbeast's firebreath attack is increased by 10
feet per rank.  This means that the higher your rank, the more accurate and
damaging your warbeast's pounce and firebreath attacks will be, and the better
you'll be at leaning out of the way of incoming attacks.

If you travel to hell from the nexus (using Pathway to Hell), each mob you kill
there will unlock a different warp.  These are usually used for Demon Form, but
your warbeast will also benefit from those which modify your breath, tail and 
(if you have Demonology) wings.  To view or apply your warps, type 'warp'.
