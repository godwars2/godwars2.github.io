This power allows you to tattoo yourself with curvilinear animal designs of
spiritual potency, using a mystical ink distilled by moonlight.  You may have
up to five separate tattoos at any one time: one on your forehead, one on your
chest, one on each forearm, and a matching pair (counts as one) on your shins.

You steal the secrets of different tattoos by defeating animal spirits within
the spirit plane, accessible with Ride the Storm.  Use the 'tattoo' command to
add new tattoos, to list those you know, and to list those you are currently
using.  Each tattoo has its own help file, although you can only view the help
files for those tattoos you know.  When the description of a tattoo refer to
your 'rank', it means your rank in Lunar Tattoos.  If you have no ranks in this
power you can still wear your tattoos, but they will provide no bonuses.

Each tattoo has different bonuses, depending on where it's placed.  You may
place the same type of tattoo on multiple locations, or different types on
different locations, as you see fit.  If you place a new tattoo over an old
one, the previous tattoo will fade away and vanish.
