This power allows you to draw upon your connection with the shadow plane in
order to become nearly invulnerable for a short period of time.  All non-mental
damage will be reduced by 95%, and this is treated as a second immunity layer.

To activate this power, type 'shadow'.  The invulnerability lasts 1 second for
each rank you have in this power, starting from the moment you are successfully
struck by a non-mental attack.  It takes 60 seconds to recharge, although you
may reactivate a partial Shadow Infusion after 30 seconds of recharging.  The
partial version gives only 1% invulnerability per rank.

At rank 20, you gain the ability to re-pause your invulnerability timer by once
again typing 'shadow'.  This also reduces the remaining duration by 5 seconds.

At rank 30, you passively gain the benefits of Shadow Infusion as long as your
adrenaline rush isn't active.  Your adrenaline rush still becomes active after
you're struck.  This does not effect your invulnerability timer in any way.

In addition, you also get +1 cold bypass per rank.  This passive bonus applies
at all times, reflecting your stronger connection to the shadow plane.
