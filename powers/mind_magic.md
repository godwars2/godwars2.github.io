This power grants you access to a range of mental spells.  Each rank gives you
+10 range, +2 Ascendancy and +1 Power to each mental spell, and also increases
the duration, strength and stat bonuses of mental spell affects.

A single rank in this power will give you Forcefield, Mind Blast, Invisibility,
Detect Invisibility and Regenerate.  At rank 5 you learn Mind Whip (with bypass
upgraded at ranks 15 and 25).  At rank 10 you learn Mindshield and Boil Blood.
At rank 15 (or rank 10 if you also have Psionics) you learn Regrowth.  At rank
20 you learn Psychic Lance.

If you also have the Psionics talent, then each rank in Mind Magic will give
you +2% mental armour and +1 mental bypass.  It will also grant you +1% mental
immunity per rank, up to a maximum of +20% at rank 20.
