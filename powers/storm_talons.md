This power infuses your talons with lightning.  Whenever your talons strike a
critical hit, they will also perform a follow-up lightning attack using the
same technique bonus as the technique you used to attack.  The lightning attack
doesn't get any bonuses for Talons of the Bear or Iron Talons, but it does gain
+3 Attack, +2 Damage and +1 bypass per rank, and the bypass also stacks with
that from Ride the Storm.  Note that the lightning attack will never miss, but
your attack rating will help determine the effectiveness of the overall attack.

If you also have Shock, your Storm Talons gain an extra +1 bypass per rank.  If
you have used Lunar Tattoos to change your Storm Talons to heat or cold bursts,
the extra +1 bypass per rank instead requires Burn or Freeze respectively.

At rank 5 you unlock the 'tc' (talons charge) command, allowing you to charge
your talons for 1 second per rank (paused until you attack with them).  While
charged, your claws only need to cause damage to perform a burst.  The delay
and AP cost of the charge technique decreases at rank 10 and 15, while at rank
20 you gain the ability to perform an enhanced charge, which makes a lightning
attack even if your claw attack misses.  The mana cost for the enhanced charge
is reduced at ranks 25 and 30.  You may recharge your claws at any time.
