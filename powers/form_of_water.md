This power allows you to partially transform yourself into a water elemental.
Physically you still appear human, although your skin becomes translucent and
your hair and eyes turn a deep shade of green.  While in this hybrid form you
gain 10% immunity to all forms of physical damage and 55% immunity to cold and
poison damage.  You may still use equipment and weapons as normal, as long as
they are items which can float in water.  Each rank you have in this power
gives +1 Speed.  Each of your first 20 ranks also give +2% physical immunity
and +1% cold/poison immunity.

While in this form, each rank automatically heals 0.5hp per second when healing
at full speed (see 'help healing').  If you've suffered wounds other than lost
limbs, half of your healing ability will be diverted into repairing the wound.

You gain +2 movement rate per rank while wet from rain or swimming.  You also
ignore currents and all terrain penalties while in Form of Water.
