Most dragons are notoriously greedy, and will gather a large hoard of treasure
which they jealously guard.  This power allows you to drain the magical energy
from your treasure hoard, and use it to infuse yourself with various bonuses.

Use the 'hoard' command to configure the bonuses and add items to the hoard as
fuel.  The item vanishes and you gain an amount of fuel equal to the age of the
monster it came from (times 10 for uncommon and times 100 for rare items).  If
the item is uncommon or rare, you unlock a +1 or +2 bypass bonus, which can be
added like any other bonus.  The first legendary, mythical, relic and artifact
item of each material you add will permanently increase the scale bonus by +1.

The bonuses from your hoard last 60 seconds, +15 seconds per rank.  Only those
bonuses for which you have sufficient fuel will be applied - for example, if
your hoard is configured to 50% Defence and 50% Damage, and you have enough
silver but not quite enough gold, you will only get the Defence bonus.

Note that you may also add gems to your hoard: rubies, pearls, sapphires, onyx,
emeralds and diamonds give the same fuel as gold, silver, copper, bronze, brass
and platinum respectively.  No other material types can be added to your hoard.
