This power causes you to grow a long spiked tail while in Demon Form, allowing 
you to make deadly attacks via the 'ts' (tail swing) command.  Each rank in
this power grants +2 Attack, Damage and bypass to the tail attack, and if the 
blow connects it will automatically perform a sonic burst attack.  If the tail 
attack achieves a critical success, your opponent will be knocked backwards.

Note that the tail attack causes dual crush/stab damage, while the sonic burst 
causes dual crush/mental damage.  Dual damage means that each time you hit, the
most effective damage type will be used, depending on your opponent.

If you have a Warbeast, it will also have this tail while you're riding it.
