This power allows you to partially transform yourself into an air elemental.
Physically you still appear human, although your skin becomes transparent and
your form appears to blur slightly as you move.  While in this hybrid form you
gain 10% immunity to all forms of physical damage and 55% immunity to shock and
poison damage.  You may still use equipment and weapons as normal, as long as
no single item has an encumbrance of more than 1.  Each rank you have in this
power gives +2 Mana and +4 Protection.  Each of your first 20 ranks also give
+2% physical immunity and +1% shock/poison immunity.
