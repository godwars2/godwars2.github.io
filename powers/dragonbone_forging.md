This power allows you to reforge dragonbone items, strengthening them with your
draconic energy.  You can use this power on both magical and non-magical items,
although the results will vary depending on what type of dragon the dragonbone
comes from; green dragon bones give no extra benefit, while red dragons give
heat bonuses, white give cold, blue give shock and black give poison bonuses.

Reforged weapons gain +1 bypass per rank, and +5% chance per rank of causing a
bone-specific burst attack on a critical hit, with +1 burst bypass per rank.

Reforged armour gains +1% physical and +1% bone-specific soak per rank, as well
as +1 physical auto-absorb per 2 ranks.

Reforged rings give you +1 physical bypass per two ranks and +1 bone-specific
bypass per rank to all attacks with all locations (including mount, if any).

You may reforge a dragonbone item at any time, specifying how much taint you
wish it to have, up to a maximum equal to twice your rank in this power.  If
you use items with a taint higher than your rank, each point of difference
counts as 25 points of radiation.  You also may remove the taint entirely.
