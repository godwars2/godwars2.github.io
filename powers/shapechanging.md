This power enhances your alternate forms.  While shapechanged, each rank gives
you +1 Attack, Defence, Damage, Ascendancy, Protection, Power and Resistance,
as well as +1 bypass for all natural attacks and +5 Health.

At rank 5, you no longer suffer penalties while shapechanging.  At rank 10,
you gain the ability to shift directly between forms, rather than having to
change back to human form first.  At rank 15 you are able to shapechange in 4
seconds rather than 5, while at rank 20 you can shapechange in only 3 seconds.

In Bat Form, this power gives your attacks a natural bypass bonus at rank 10,
upgraded at ranks 20 and 30.  At rank 40 the AP cost of your attacks is reduced
by 25, while at rank 50 the delay on your attacks is reduced by 1.

In Mist Form you gain 'hv' (head vortex), which works like Shadow Infusion,
except only against physical and cold damage, and without the bypass or ranked
bonuses.  Your strike will now inflict bursts if you also have the appropriate
Blood Runes on your hands, while your tendrils gain a natural bypass bonus at
rank 10, upgraded at 30 and 50, +50 range at rank 20 and -1 delay at rank 40.
