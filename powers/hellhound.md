This power allows you to summon a hellhound to assist you in combat.  Your 
hellhound's skills and styles improve in the same way as a PC, and if killed it
may be resummoned back at your home plane without any loss of progress.  The 
hellhound will follow simple verbal commands such as 'kill', 'north', 'follow',
'leave' and 'style' (see 'help pets').  Type 'summon hellhound' to summon him.

Each time your hellhound kills an opponent of at least half its Age, one of 
its stats will raise, until it reaches its maximum Age (stat total) of ten 
times your rank.  Please note that if you lower your rank in this power below 
10% of the Age of your hellhound, you will have to type 'summon hellhound 
rebirth' to resummon it, and this will reset it to a pup.  At Ages 20, 40, 
60, 80 and 100 your hellhound will grow, and discover new fighting tactics.

Your hellhound has a number of ranks in Demon Form equal to 10% of its age, 
rounded down.  At age 50 also it gains 10% of its age in Tainted Flesh ranks.

Your hellhound also gains some talents based on your rank in this power: Sure 
Footed at rank 5, Evasion at rank 10, Instinctive Dodge at rank 20, Toughness 
at rank 30 and Endurance at rank 40.
