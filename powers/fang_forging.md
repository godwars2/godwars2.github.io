This power allows you to craft fang necklaces and bracelets, each of which can
hold up to 100 points of radiation for each rank you have in Fang Forging.  To
rip a fang from a corpse, target it and perform a rip attack with your claw.  
To insert a fang into a necklace, wield both then use the fang.

Every 100 radiation in a necklace gives it 1 point of spiritual energy, which
grants +2 Aura per point while in human form up to a maximum equal to your rank
in this power (eg, +10 Aura with 10 ranks, if the necklace has 500+ radiation).

If your fang necklace has at least 1 point of spiritual energy, it gives +1%
natural armour vs mental and poison damage per rank, regardless of form.  In
wolfman form, you also gain +1% natural armour vs physical damage per rank.

Your fang bracelets don't gain the Aura or armour bonuses, but if you also have
the Spirit Binding power they can be given physical or elemental bypass.

The 'forge' command lets you create fang necklaces and bracelets.  It may also
be used to enhance weapons and armour made from bone, leather or animal skin,
although this process adds 1 taint per rank.   If you use items with more taint
than your rank, each point of difference is treated as 10 points of radiation.

### Tips

- Consider investing one rank in this power to get the ripfang technique so you can start collecting fangs, even if you don't actually want to forge anything.
- You can wear both a fang necklace and a collar in human and wolfman form, but only one of the two in Wolf Form.
