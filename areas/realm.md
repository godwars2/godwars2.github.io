### Arcane Catacombs

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
20460 -3960 | Class Dungeon | Magi, elementals

Near the mouth of Crescent River on the eastern island, a complex of catacombs
serves as experimentation grounds to a school of magi. Aspiring mages can
journey here to seek enlightenment and pass the final trial by besting the
local magi and their summoned creatures in combat, to receive their tokens.

### Blackstone Mountain

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
-4000 -3000 | Mountain | Mountain lions

The Blackstone Mountain dominating the western island is not particularly high,
but its close proximity to the sea makes its conical shape impressive enough.
To the north it slopes towards Blackwood Forest, and on the southern side
stands an ancient labyrinth constructed from the local granite that gave the
mountain its name.

### Blackwood Forest

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
-4300 500 | Forest | Brown bears

No one really knows how the Blackwood Forest got its name, probably as an
etymological reflection of the nearby Blackstone Mountain.  The forest is not
dense, nor does it produce dark timber, being mostly pine and fir.  Brown bears
in search of berries and bee hives can be seen wandering around their dens in
the terraced, fern-covered ground.

### Blackwood River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
-4700 -2200 and -2500 2700 | River | None

The western island is divided in half by this river, as it flows north down the
slopes of Blackstone Mountain and then takes a sharp turn east along the
northern edge of Blackwood Forest, towards the sea.

### Blood Warrens

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
15114 3234 | Class Dungeon | Rats, wolves

The Blood Warrens lie just north of Storm River, on the eastern island. Wolves
that may not be wolves at all and rats that may not be rats have been spotted
here, and some of those that have visited the place have returned as vampires.
If you believe that should be your fate, seek the bloodguard champions and
obtain your tokens from them. But be warned that they will not give them up
without a fight.

### Crescent River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
21100 150 and 21100 -4700 | River | None

Far on the eastern island, among the steep canyons and crevices of Mount
Stormreach, a hot spring flows from the ground near the Hellmouth entrance,
widening into a river further on, as it takes a slow, moon-shaped turn towards
the west and back to the east, around the Arcane Catacombs and to the sea.  The
water is rich in iron and sulphur and the river itself whimsical and devoid of
life, which may be why some consider it cursed.

### Darkroot River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
10500 16000 and 17800 10000 | River | None

The dark, murky waters of Darkroot River make it hard to believe this is, in
fact, an offshoot of the sparkling, foaming Silver River.  As it winds its way
southeast through Twilight Wood, dead leaves and rotten branches gather in
stale pools between tree roots.  Upturned, moss-covered trunks block off whole
sections of the river, where the water is littered with decayed remains of
small creatures and emits a putrid, nauseating stench.

### Eel River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
10500, 4600 and 13100 2000 | River | Eels

The short river that flows from Mirror Lake eastwards to the sea got its name
from the numerous eels that inhabit its underwater pools and holes dug into the
muddy riverbank.  It is the only river that carries the lake waters into the
ocean, and while not very wide, it is deep and treacherous.

### Firetop Mountain

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
2700 15700 | Mountain | Mountain lions

Named after the crater at its top, Firetop Mountain is an active volcano
located about twenty furlongs north of Glyphstone Village.  Red dragon
hatchlings can be sometimes seen swimming in the lava and a narrow ledge at the
eastern side of the crater descends deep into the heart of the volcano.  Lions
inhabit the lower mountain slopes and gnomes run a mine nested between the
soutwestern cliffs.

### Firetop Volcano

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
2655 15804 | Volcano | Red dragon hatchlings

Named after the crater at its top, Firetop Mountain is an active volcano
located about twenty furlongs north of Glyphstone Village.  Red dragon
hatchlings can be sometimes seen swimming in the lava and a narrow ledge at the
eastern side of the crater descends deep into the heart of the volcano.  Lions
inhabit the lower mountain slopes and gnomes run a mine nested between the
soutwestern cliffs.

### Glyphstone Village

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
0 0 | Settlement | Villagers and guards

As the only civilised settlement in the realm, Glyphstone village is the place
where all adventures begin.  The practice grounds, prison and dojo offer an
opportunity to practice combat skills.  There is also an arena and several
duelling grounds where you can match your skills against that of both friends
and foes.

### Greenleaf Forest

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
5000 5000 | Forest | Goblins and wolves

The Greenleaf Forest stretches between the southeastern slopes of Firetop
Mountain and the western shore of Mirror Lake, a short ride northeast from
Glyphstone Village.  Wolves and bears prowl around during the day, and at night
goblins emerge from a dark cave in the heart of the forest and scout the
landscape, looking for small prey.

### Hellmouth

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
21714 0 | Class Dungeon | Demons

A deep abyss on the eastern slopes of Mount Stormreach is told to connect the
Realm Plane with Hell. Although the portal itself has never been found, the
demonic creatures inhabiting this place give credibility to the rumours. It is
told that by defeating the Dark Reaver champions and gaining their tokens, one
can become a demon, forever bound to the infernal plane.

### Mirror Lake

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
10000 6500 | Lake | Naga and blue dragon hatchlings

Bordered by Greenleaf Forest on the western side, the Cursed Swamp in the south
and Twilight Wood at the northern end, the clear, glittering surface Mirror
Lake reflects the sky above.  Blue dragon hatchlings play in the water during
the day, and nagas inhabit a damp cave on the northern shore.

### Misty Forest

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
19000 6000 | Forest | Wolfkin and timber wolves

The dense woodland north of Mount Stormreach is perpetually hidden in thick
mist which condenses on the leaves and trickles down to the soggy ground.  High
air humidity together with swarms of gnats discourage explorers, making the
forest a safe hideout for a tribe of wolfkin, whose thick pelts provide
protection from both weather and insect bites.

### Mount Stormreach

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
20000 0 | Mountain | None

Mount Stormreach, located on the eastern island, is the highest mountain in the
Realm.  Its summit disappears in the clouds, which, together with the
bottomless canyons and chasms that cut into the mountainside, has led to the
belief that it connects Heaven and Hell.  The frequent lightning storms have
been interpreted as signs of battle between the two dimensions, although
scholars of more agnostic nature attribute them to condensation and differences
in air temperature.

### Shadowglade Forest

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
2000 21000 | Forest | Black bears, timber wolves and unicorns

A long stretch of woods running along the northern side of Firetop Mountain is
known as Shadowglade Forest.  Ancient oaks and silver-leaved beech trees hum
and rustle in the wind, interspersed with aspens and willows where the Serpent
River divides the forest in half.  During the day, unicorns can be sometimes
glimpsed between the trees, although they are shy of intruders who often hunt
them for their magical horns.

### Shimmer Pond

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
11880 0 | Pond | None

This tiny pond is famed for its shimmering waters, which sparkle with magic,
even when Cin is sitting in it (which is most of the time).

### Snow River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
1300 13350 and 8600 5900 | River | White dragon hatchlings

Snow River starts its way as a small brook, high on the slopes of Firetop
Mountain.  By the time it reaches the plains, it is a roaring stream that
widens further on, before it enters Greenleaf Forest and after that, Mirror
Lake.  Its waters are ice-cold, much to the joy of the white dragon hatchlings
who can be seen frolicking in the river during the day.

### Storm River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
19100 -200 and 15183 1280 | River | None

Storm River starts its way near the summit of Mount Stormreach, fed by numerous
rivulets that change its course with every new shower.  It descends steeply
north, gains strength as it passes through the soggy ground of Misty Forest,
and turns back southwest towards the shores of the island, where it falls to
the ocean in a roaring waterfall.

### Tartarus

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
20394 21054 | Desert | Nomads

### The Abandoned Temple

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
-792 2508 | Settlement | None

Located a short ride to the northwest from the village is an abandoned temple,
with its crypt lying in ruins. Various undead beings and cadaver eaters have
infested its dark corridors, but an avatar with some training should be able to
handle these primitive beasts rather easily - and, who knows, maybe leave with
magical treasure. If you are looking for your first dungeon adventure, enter
the temple from the north and try your luck in the crypt.

### The Black Castle

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
594 -660 | Settlement | None

Living for years in the seclusion of his castle, the Black knight does not
entertain visitors. He is a skilled warrior, and his armour is rumoured to be
unnaturally light and strong. Many a freshly born avatar, seduced by the
proximity of the castle and the easy journey, has fallen victim to his blade -
or has defeated him only to find themselves face to face with a bloodthirsty
suprenaturalis. Unlike most of the realm, the tower is a playerkilling area.

### The Crater

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
2706 15774 | Dungeon | Fire elementals, dragons

Legends say that a mighty firebreathing dragon lives deep within the crater of
the Firetop Mountain, and even attribute the occasional eruption to this beast.
Whether the latter is true, opinions differ, but scorched adventurers, some of
them missing limbs, make it back to Glyphstone village from time to time,
telling tales of strange beings formed of plasma and of a she-dragon that can
bite off a man's head as if it were candy.  Only one way to find out if these
tales are true - but what fool would venture into a lava-filled crater?

### The Crimson River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
5930 4110 and -1800 700 | River | None

From the northern gates of Glyphstone Village, Crimson River can be seen
flowing lazily to the western shores where it meets the ocean.  Far upstream,
where it winds its way southwards from the goblin cave, it flows more swiftly,
forming small rapids and whirlpools between cliffs and tree roots.

### The Crypt

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
-792 2376 | Dungeon | Undead, cadaver eaters

Located a short ride to the northwest from the village is an abandoned temple,
with its crypt lying in ruins.  Various undead beings and cadaver eaters have
infested its dark corridors, but an avatar with some training should be able to
handle these primitive beasts rather easily - and, who knows, maybe leave with
magical treasure.  If you are looking for your first dungeon adventure, enter
the temple from the north and try your luck in the crypt.

### The Cursed Swamp

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
8500 0 | Swamp | Crocodiles

A dead branch of Mirror Lake, known as The Ooze, disappears south of the lake,
into the marshy grounds of the Cursed Swamp.  Crocodiles so large that they can
swallow a grown warrior alive, as well as the waterlogged soil and bog holes
make most travellers avoid the area.

### The Damp Cave

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
11550 9174 | Dungeon | Nagas

A half-submerged cavern complex on the northern shore of Mirror Lake is home to
a tribe of nagas, led by their queen.  The naga males are mostly warriors,
skilled with kris and trident, as are the females of the lower castes.  The
higher caste females, easily recognised by the blue colour of their skin, are
talented magic users.  The queen herself is a powerful psionic, and is known
wide and far for her skill with two whips.

### The Dark Cave

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
6006 4026 | Dungeon | Goblins

Deep within Greenleaf Forest, near the source of the Crimson River, a smelly
hole leads into a goblin lair.  The goblins will protect their lair and their
king with crude weapons and primitive magic, and gnaw on the bones of any
intruder they manage to corner and defeat.  While even a single fanatic can
catch an unprepared adventurer by surprise, the goblins' main strength lies in
numbers.

### The Labyrinth

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
-4290 -4026 | Dungeon | Minotaurs

Nobody knows who built the labyrinth on the southern slopes of Blackstone
Mountain, but scholars agree it was not the minotaurs.  More likely, the
minotaurs have been once guardians of whatever purpose the structure served,
and formed their own society after the labyrinth had been deserted.  Having
been bred for fighting, they know little else and will attack intruders on
sight.  The labyrinth is a dangerous place to explore, best left to those with
a lot of combat expertise - or those bored with life.

### The Mine

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
0 9900 | Dungeon | Gnomes

Gnomes operate a mine at the southwestern side of Firetop Mountain.  The work
is hard, and the threat of being attacked by a basilisk, a promethean, or even
a treasure hunter is omnipresent.  Gnome soldiers try their best to protect the
miners as they go about their work, but the monsters inhabiting the dark
tunnels are fierce, and fatalities are an everyday reality.  Somehow, however,
the gnomes manage to carry on working to the satisfaction of their chieftain.

### The Northern Desert

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
21000 21000 | Desert | Nomads

Far behind Twilight Wood, at the northeastern end of the main island, lies a
hostile area known as the Northern Desert.  Sand dunes stretch in every
direction, and the two oases can be hard to find for anybody but the nomad
tribes roaming the area.

### The Ooze

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
9900 2575 | River | Crocodiles and prometheans

The Ooze is not a real river - it is a dead branch that extends out of the
southern part of Mirror Lake and disappears shortly after in the marshy grounds
of the Cursed Swamp.  Its stale, muddy waters are favoured by crocodiles that
float on the surface, resembling dead logs, ready to swallow an unwary
traveller or one of the prometheans that prowl along the banks.

### The Serpent River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
1300 15700 and 2600 23700 | River | None

Serpent River is the last of the three rivers that have its start on Firetop
Mountain.  It flows northwards, through Shadowglade Forest to the sea,
peacefully meandering between the trees and clearings like a giant
silver-skinned snake.

### The Silver River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
4450 17850 and 10500 8500 | River | None

Upstream, in a deep canyon on the northern slopes of Firetop Mountain, Silver
River cascades in small waterfalls, which turn into dangerous whirlpools during
springtime.  The micaceous rocks glittering at its bottom have often been
mistaken for silver, and have given the river its name.  In the plains below,
the river meanders south to where it joins the waters of Mirror Lake.

### Thunder River

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
18500 6800 and 18500 8000 | River | None

This short, wide stream is an offshoot of Storm River, parting from the main
watercourse deep within Misty Forest where the omnipresent moisture widens its
flow, and continuing northwards to meet the sea.

### Twilight Wood

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
14000 15000 | Forest | Black bears, timber wolves and wraiths

The dark and dense Twilight Wood is merely dangerous during the day, with its
treacherous terrain and wild bears and wolves lurking in the shadows.  When the
night falls, wraiths emerge from the mists hanging low above the Blackroot
River, their numbers getting stronger with each victim they lure to a watery
death.

### Wolfkin Den

Coordinates | Area type | Inhabitants
---|---|---
21054 5940 | Class Dungeon | Wolfkin

Far to the east, on an island, the wolfkin have built a den in a misty forest.
Should you want to become one of the pack, a werewolf, you will need to prove
yourself by defeating their champion and earning magical tokens as a prize for
your victory.
