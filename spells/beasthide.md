Beasthide is a defensive buff which gives the Defensive Shield bonus, and 
benefits from Strong Magical Shields.

The beasthide gives you a base bonus of +10 Resistance, or +15 if the spell is 
enhanced.  Your green magic is then applied as a percentage modifier to the 
base bonus (eg green magic 100 would give +100%, thus doubling the base bonus).
After applying your green magic, you get a further +5 Resistance per rank.

The Arctic Wolfkin talent doubles the above Resistance bonus, while Thick Pelt 
doubles the duration, and adds Defence and armour bonuses.  Strong Magical 
Shields increases the armour bonus even further.
