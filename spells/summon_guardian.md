This spell summons a guardian demon, who will immediately attack your current 
target (if any), and can also be given orders (see 'help pets').

The guardian demon starts with Size 6, and all other stats at 5.  However it 
also gets +1 Brawn and Mettle per rank, +1 Size per 2 ranks and +1 Grace and 
Wits per 4 ranks.

Note that you may only ever have 3 spell summoned creatures at any one time.
