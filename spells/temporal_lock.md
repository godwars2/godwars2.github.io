Temporal Lock is an indirect attack spell which targets your opponent's body 
and inflicts mental damage, although it only inflicts a single point of actual 
damage.  If your spell is successful, a shimmering aura will appear around 
your opponent, making them vulnerable to your Temporal Shift spell.
