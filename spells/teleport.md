Teleport is a movement spell which transports you from your current location 
to your currently targeted destination.  You can only teleport to creatures, 
objects, dungeons and buildings if they are within your line of sight, but 
specific coordinates can be teleported to without visibility.

Note that if you try to teleport into solid matter, the spell will fail.
