The red version of Dispel Magic is an indirect attack spell which targets your 
opponent's body and inflicts mental damage, although it only inflicts a single 
point of actual damage.  If your spell is successful, a random positive spell 
will be flushed from your opponent (see 'help affects').  On a critical hit, 
all positive spells will be flushed.

The blue version of this spell is always successful, and flushes all negative 
spells from your target.  The green version of this spell always targets the 
caster, and automatically flushes all positive and negative spells.
