Drain Heat is an indirect attack spell which targets the internals and inflicts
cold damage.  It only works against creatures with flesh, and on a critical hit
the opponent will be coated in a layer of frost which lasts for 10 seconds, +2 
seconds per rank.  This layer of frost gives your opponent -2 heat armour per 
rank, +1 cold armour per rank and -1 Speed per 2 ranks.  If your opponent is 
already coated in a layer of frost, then the duration will be renewed.

Note that the armour bonuses and penalties for this spell are part of the spell
armour layer, which includes all magical affects, as well as any magical item 
bonuses which give armour to all locations (such as 'bracers of armour').  The 
spell armour layer can never be reduced below 0%, so if your opponent has no 
other spell armour then the heat armour penalty won't actually do anything.
