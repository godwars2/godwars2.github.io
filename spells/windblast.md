Windblast is a direct attack spell which strikes everyone within range, as 
long as they are standing (prone targets are ignored).  If the victim is 
within 10 feet, they will be knocked over on a successful hit.  If they are 
further than 10 feet away, all of their combat locations will be cleared on 
a successful hit.
