This spell allows you to sense the presence of other creatures.  After casting,
there will be a 3 second wait, after which you'll be informed of the location 
of any other creatures nearby.  You can sense up to 1 creature per 10 ranks.

If the creature is within 500 feet, plus 5 feet for each monster they've killed
the current day, plus 15 feet per rank (or 30 feet per rank if you've enhanced 
the spell), you will be able to sense their approximate distance and direction.
You will also be able to sense the direction (but not distance) of creatures at
up to three times that range.

Note that Improved Spell Range does apply to this spell.
