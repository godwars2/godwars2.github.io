This spell conjures a blade of animated fire, which can be used in the same 
way as any other weapon.  The fireblade is ethereal, meaning it can only parry 
or be parried by other ethereal weapons, and it inflicts pure heat damage.  It 
has +1 Attack and Defence per rank, and +1 Damage per 2 ranks.

If you have 10+ ranks in Fire Magic or Pathway to Hell, each rank in Elemental
Binding or Infernal Binding will give the fireblade a +5% chance of causing a 
heat burst on a critical hit (see 'help burst'), and +1 bypass for the burst.
