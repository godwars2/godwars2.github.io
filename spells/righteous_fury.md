Righteous Fury is a defensive buff which gives +5 Attack and Defence (modified 
by green magic) and +5 Damage.  Werewolves with the Fang Forging power gain an 
additional +5 Attack and Defence (modified by green magic) and +5 Damage per 
rank, and +1 Speed for every two ranks.

Once this spell expires, you will suffer -5 Speed and -10 Attack, Defence and
Damage.  This exhaustion penalty lasts for 30 seconds.  Tireless Rage works on 
this exhaustion in the same way as it does the Berserker Rage exhaustion.

If you have the Berserker Rage talent, its bonuses will automatically be added 
to this spell.  The spell duration is doubled if you have Tireless Rage.

Note that this spell counts as a Rage for the purposes of fear spells and 
powers, and grants the usual immunity to pain penalties (see 'help pain').
