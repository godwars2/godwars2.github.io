Dimensional Anchor is an indirect attack spell which targets your opponent's 
legs and inflicts mental damage, although it only inflicts a single point of 
actual damage.  If your spell is successful, a glowing dimensional anchor will
materialise around your opponent's legs, giving them 1% chance per rank of 
teleportation failure, and increasing the AP cost of their feet commands by +1
per rank.  If the feet AP penalty exceeds any bonuses your opponent has from 
other spells or equipment, they will also suffer +1 feet cooldown.

Note that this spell doesn't work on swarm creatures, for obvious reasons.
