Tenebrous Chains is an indirect attack spell which targets your opponent's legs
and inflicts mental damage, although it only inflicts a single point of actual 
damage.  If your spell is successful, dark chains will burst from the ground 
and coil around your opponent's legs, reducing their movement rate by half your
rank (rounded up) and giving them 1% chance per rank of teleportation failure.

Note that this spell doesn't work on swarm creatures, for obvious reasons.
