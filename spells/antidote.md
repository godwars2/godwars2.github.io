Antidote is a defensive buff which gives the caster +2% spell armour per rank 
against poison damage.  If you enhance the spell, the duration is doubled and 
you get an additional +1% internal poison immunity per rank over 20.  Recasting
the spell will renew the duration but leave the bonuses, allowing you to cast 
an enhanced version once and then maintain the immunity with unenhanced spells.
