This spell allows you to strengthen your body's regenerative ability for a 
number of seconds equal to one of your base stats; Tenacity is used by Dark 
Lineage and Regeneration, Discipline by Psionics, and Mettle by Hydra Breed 
and Salamanders Gift.  While affected by this spell you will always heal at 
full regen rate, even if struck by a critical hit (see 'help healing').

The enhanced version of this spell costs 1 mana per second, and has a duration 
equal to the number of seconds required to heal to full health (your base stat 
is NOT added to this).  If you don't have enough mana to completely heal, the 
spell will use all of your remaining mana.  If the duration is less than or 
equal to your non-enhanced duration, the spell won't be enhanced.
