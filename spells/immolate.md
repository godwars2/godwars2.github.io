Immolate is a direct attack spell which targets the body and inflicts heat 
damage.  On a critical hit, your opponent will burst into flames for 5 seconds,
+1 second per rank.  Every second that your opponent is on fire, they will take
100 points of damage, +2 points of damage per rank.

At rank 15 Fire Magic or Pathway to Hell you can enhance your immolate, causing
your opponent to burst into flames (as described above) on a regular hit.

Note that if your opponent lies down in water, the fire will be extinguished.
