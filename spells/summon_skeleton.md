This spell summons a skeleton, who will immediately attack your current target 
(if any), and can also be given orders (see 'help pets').

If you enhance this spell, the skeleton will automatically step in front of any
attacks aimed at you, as long as it is right beside you.  It cannot protect you
from indirect spells or backstabs, but it will intercept most attacks and then 
try to parry or block them normally.  You may only have one skeleton guard at a
time, if you summon another then the first will stop guarding you.

A single skeleton has a Divine Age of 45.  If you are a full Lich, you instead 
summon an entire unit of skeletons, which is treated as swarm creature with a 
Divine Age equal to your own.

Note that you may only ever have 3 spell summoned creatures at any one time.
