This transmutation spell modifies a piece of armour, adding an amount of Shadow
Flux equal to a third of its total physical soak (i.e., cut, stab and crush), 
then reducing that physical soak to 0%.  Each point of Shadow Flux on an item 
gives it +1% cold soak.  You may wear a total amount of shadow Flux equal to 
your rank in Path of Shadows without penalty, but each point beyond that will 
be treated as if it were a point of radiation.

If you cast this spell a second time on the same item (or if the item has no 
physical soak), it will gain additional points of Shadow Flux equal to the 
average of its heat and shock armour, and those two soak types will then also 
be reduced to 0%.  You cannot cast this spell more than twice on the same item.

Note that this spell only works if the item's total physical soak (or combined 
heat and shock soak for the second casting) is equal or less than 10% of your 
combined rating in Yellow Magic and Meditate.  This spell will not work if the 
item has no physical soak (or no heat/shock soak for the second casting).
