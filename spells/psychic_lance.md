Psychic Lance is an indirect attack spell which targets your opponent's head 
and inflicts mental damage.  It only works on creatures with minds.

If your spell achieves a critical hit, you twist the psychic lance within your 
opponent's mind, inflicting an internal mental burst attack (see 'help burst').
