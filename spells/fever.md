Fever is an indirect attack spell which targets your opponent's body, and needs
to be able to inflict mental damage to succeed (although no actual damage is 
inflicted).  It only works on living creatures with hearts.

If your spell is successful, your opponent will suffer -5 Attack, Ascendancy, 
Damage and Power per rank, with your red magic applied as a percentage modifier
to the Attack and Ascendancy.
