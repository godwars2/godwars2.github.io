Barkskin is a defensive buff which gives the Defensive Shield bonus (but not 
Enhanced Shield, so you'll want to use forcefield as well).

The barkskin gives you a base bonus of +10 Defence, or +15 if the spell is 
enhanced.  Your green magic is then applied as a percentage modifier, and the 
result is increased by a further +5 per rank.  You also get a Resistance bonus
equal to half of the final Defence bonus.
