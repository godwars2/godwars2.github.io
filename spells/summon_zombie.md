This spell summons a zombie, who will immediately attack your current target 
(if any), and can also be given orders (see 'help pets').

If you enhance this spell, the zombie will entangle its opponent on a critical 
hit when using its bare hands.

A single zombie has a Divine Age of 45.  If you are a full Lich, you instead 
summon an entire unit of zombies, which is treated as swarm creature with a 
Divine Age equal to your own.  A swarm of zombies may continue attacking 
while entangling an opponent.

Note that you may only ever have 3 spell summoned creatures at any one time.
