Frost is an indirect attack spell which targets your opponent's body, and needs
to be able to inflict mental damage to succeed (although no actual damage is 
inflicted).  It only works on living creatures.

If your spell is successful, your opponent will suffer -1 Speed, -1 movement 
rate, -5 Defence and -5 Protection per rank, with your red magic applied as a 
percentage modifier to the Defence and Protection.
