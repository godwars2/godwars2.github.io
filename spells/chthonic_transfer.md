Chthonic Transfer is a defensive buff which converts 1 point of Aura per rank 
in Earth Magic into a point of Brawn, Mettle or Size, whichever has the highest
base stat.  In the case of a tie, the points will be split among two (or even 
all three) of the stats.

If you have both Elemental Scion and Earthborn Adept, your rank in Earth Magic
will be doubled for the purposes of this spell.

This spell doesn't convert base Aura, or Aura bonuses from worn equipment.  If 
you don't have sufficient Aura, this spell will just convert as much as it can.
