Stoneskin is a defensive buff which gives the caster 95% immunity to physical 
damage.  The spell lasts 1 second per rank, starting from the moment you are 
successfully struck by an attack that inflicts cut, stab or crush damage.

This spell causes Earth Burnout, which requires 60 seconds to recharge.
