This spell summons a minor elemental, who will immediately attack your current
target (if any), and can also be given orders (see 'help pets').  The type of 
elemental summoned will be based on your highest rank, or in the order given 
above in the case of a tie (eg Fire, then Air, then Water, then Earth).

The elemental's Size is randomly generated in the range 4 to 7, while all of 
its other stats are fixed at 5.  However it also gets +1 Grace and Wits per 
rank, and +1 Brawn and Mettle per 2 ranks.

Note that you may only ever have 3 spell summoned creatures at any one time.
