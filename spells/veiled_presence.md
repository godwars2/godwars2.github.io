Veiled presence is a utility buff which conceals you from sight.  If you attack
while using it you will become a blurred shape, although your opponent will 
still suffer a -25% penalty to their defence, unless they are able to see you 
through the spell.

In order to see through your veiled presence, viewers must be able to equal or 
exceed your rank in this spell with their own detection powers or spells.

Unlike regular invisibility, which conceals you by bending light around your 
body, veiled presence instead works by clouding the minds of those who look at 
you, tricking them into thinking you're not there.  Although the end result is 
exactly the same as invisibility, this alternative approach means that you can 
stack the two spells together.  Veiled presence will also stack with Cloak of 
Shadows, or the stealth option from Assassin Training.
