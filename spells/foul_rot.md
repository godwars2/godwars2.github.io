Foul Rot is an indirect attack spell which targets the internals and inflicts
poison damage.  It only works against creatures with flesh, and on a critical 
hit the opponent's flesh will rot, lasting for 10 seconds, +2 seconds per rank.
This rot gives your opponent -5 Resistance, -1 Resistance per rank.  If your 
opponent's flesh is already rotting, then the duration will be renewed.
