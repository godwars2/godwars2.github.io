This spell renews the summoning duration of all your undead.  It also affects 
you with Empower undead, with exactly the same duration, allowing you to keep 
better track of how much longer your undead will remain in existence.

If you enhance this spell, the duration will be doubled.  Should you summon 
further undead while affected by this spell, their duration will be set to 
the same as your Empower Undead if that is higher than their normal duration.

You may renew this spell as often as you wish simply by recasting it.
