This spell summons a wight, who will immediately attack your current target 
(if any), and can also be given orders (see 'help pets').

If you enhance this spell, the wight will transfer stolen lifeforce to you on 
a critical hit.  This stolen lifeforce will last for 1 second per rank, during 
which time you will always heal at full regen rate.  Furthermore, your regen 
rate will be increased by 0.5hp per rank, and your body will automatically 
repair lost limbs and other serious wounds.

A single wight has a Divine Age of 45.  If you are a full Lich, you instead 
summon an entire unit of wights, which is treated as swarm creature with a 
Divine Age equal to your own.

Note that you may only ever have 3 spell summoned creatures at any one time.
