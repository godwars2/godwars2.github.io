Spiritshield is a defensive buff which gives the Enhanced Shield bonus, and 
benefits from Strong Magical Shields in the same way as the forcefield spell.

The spiritshield gives you a base bonus of +10 Defence and Protection, or +15 
if the spell is enhanced.  Your green magic is then applied as a percentage 
modifier to the base bonus (eg green magic 100 would give +100%, thus doubling
the base bonus).  After applying your green magic modifier, you get a further 
+5 Defence and Protection per rank.
