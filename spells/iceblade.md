This spell conjures a blade of animated ice, which can be used in the same way 
as any other weapon.  The iceblade is ethereal, meaning it can only parry or 
be parried by other ethereal weapons, and it inflicts pure cold damage.  It 
has +1 Attack and Defence per rank, and +1 Damage per 2 ranks.

If you have 10+ ranks in Water Magic, each rank in Elemental Binding will give
the iceblade a +5% chance of causing a cold burst on a critical hit (see 'help
burst'), and +1 bypass for the burst.
