Demonhide is a defensive buff which gives the Defensive Shield bonus, and 
benefits from Strong Magical Shields.

The demonhide gives you a base bonus of +10 Resistance, or +15 if the spell is 
enhanced.  Your green magic is then applied as a percentage modifier to the 
base bonus (eg green magic 100 would give +100%, thus doubling the base bonus).
After applying your green magic, you get a further +5 Resistance per rank.

Tough Hide doubles both the duration and the Resistance bonus, and also adds an
armour bonus.  Strong Magical Shields increases the armour bonus even further.
