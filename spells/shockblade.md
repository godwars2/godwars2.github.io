This spell conjures a blade of animated lightning, which can be used in the 
same way as any other weapon.  The shockblade is ethereal, meaning it can only
parry or be parried by other ethereal weapons, and it inflicts pure shock 
damage.  It has +1 Attack and Defence per rank, and +1 Damage per 2 ranks.

If you have 10+ ranks in Air Magic or Greater Crow Spirit, each rank in 
Elemental Binding or Spirit Binding will give the shockblade a +5% chance of 
causing a shock burst on a critical hit (see 'help burst'), and +1 bypass for 
the burst.
