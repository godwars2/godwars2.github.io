This spell summons a murder of crows, who will immediately attack your current
target (if any), and can also be given orders (see 'help pets').

The crows are treated as a single creature with Brawn 6, Grace 10, Mettle 6, 
Size 10, Wits 10, Tenacity 6, Discipline 1 and Aura 1.  Each rank gives an 
additional +1 Grace, Size, Wits and Tenacity, while every odd rank gives +1 
Brawn, and every even rank gives +1 Mettle.

Note that you may only ever have 3 spell summoned creatures at any one time.
