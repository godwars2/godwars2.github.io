This spell allows you to continually rejuvenate your body, repairing injuries
you receive in combat.  Each rank in Water Magic allows you to heal 0.1hp per 
second when healing at full speed (see 'help healing').

The enhanced version of this spell costs 100 mana, and instantly restores you
to full health.  However this version of the spell also causes Water Burnout,
which is a special type of wound that can only be removed by dying, or by
restoring yourself on your home plane.

You cannot cast this spell (neither the enhanced nor the normal version) if
you are suffering from Water Burnout.
