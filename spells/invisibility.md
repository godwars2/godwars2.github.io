Invisibility is a utility buff which conceals you from sight.  If you attack 
while invisible you will become a blurred shape, although your opponent will 
still suffer a -25% penalty to their defence, unless they are able to see 
through your invisibility.

Your rank will be calculated depending on whether you cast this spell with a 
head-based psionic technique, or a hand-based magic technique.  If you don't 
have any of the appropriate powers, your rank will be treated as 1.

In order to see through your invisibility, viewers must be able to equal or 
exceed your rank in this spell with their own detection powers or spells.
