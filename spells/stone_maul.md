This spell conjures a stone maul, which can be used in the same way as any 
other weapon.  The maul is weightless and extremely durable.  It has +1 Attack
and Defence per rank, and +1 Damage and crush bypass per 2 ranks.

If you have 10+ ranks in Earth Magic, each rank in Elemental Binding will 
give the maul a +5% chance of causing a crush burst on a critical hit (see 
'help burst'), and +1 bypass for the burst.
