Drain Lifeforce is an indirect attack spell which targets the internals and 
inflicts mental damage.  It only works against creatures with a lifeforce or 
some other animating energy, and on a critical hit you will absorb some of 
this stolen lifeforce into yourself for a short time.

A stolen portion of lifeforce gives +1 spell armour vs mental damage per rank, 
and +1 mental bypass per 2 ranks, lasting 2 seconds per rank (doubled if you 
also have Dark Conduit).  This duration cannot be renewed, but you may hold 
one portion of lifeforce at a time for every 10 ranks.
