Spectral Shield is a defensive buff which gives the Enhanced Shield bonus, and 
benefits from Strong Magical Shields.

The spell gives +10 Defence and Protection.  Your green magic is then applied 
as a percentage modifier to this bonus (eg green magic 100 would give +100%, 
doubling the bonus).  If enhanced, the spell becomes permanent and gives you a 
further +10 Resistance (although this is not modified by your green magic).

After applying your green magic modifier, you gain a further +5 Defence and 
Protection (and Resistance if enhanced) per rank in Control Death, with 
Apocalyptic Destiny counting as 5 ranks.
