Burning Fury is a defensive buff which grants the caster +2 Attack per rank, 
+1 Damage per rank, and immunity to pain penalties (see 'help pain').

Note that this spell counts as a Rage for the purposes of fear spells and 
powers.  It cannot be cast on someone who is already in a rage, and the spell 
will immediately expire if the recipient activates another rage ability.
