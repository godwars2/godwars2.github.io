Fireball is a direct attack spell which has a 25% chance of hitting the head 
or face, and a 50% chance of hitting the body.  It inflicts heat damage.

If your fireball scores a critical hit it will explode, inflicting a heat burst
attack on the same location that the original fireball hit (see 'help burst').

At rank 10 Fire Magic or Greater Crow Spirit you gain the ability to enhance
your fireball, causing it to explode as described above, even on a regular hit.
