Portal is a movement spell which creates two magical gateways, one beside you 
and the other beside your currently targeted destination.  You can only open 
a portal to creatures, objects, dungeons and buildings if they are within your
line of sight, but you can open a portal to specific coordinates without the 
need for visibility.
