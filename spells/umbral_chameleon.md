Umbral chameleon is a utility buff which hides you from sight.  If you attack 
while using it you will become a blurred shape, although your opponent will 
still suffer a -25% penalty to their defence, unless they are able to see you 
through the spell.

In order to see through this spell, viewers must be able to equal or exceed
your base Aura of 4 with their own detection powers or spells.
